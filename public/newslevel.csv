Pop Mart,How Labubu from Hong Kong conquered global pop culture - Dimsum Daily,2025-04-24 12:11:57,"24th April 2025 – (Hong Kong) The global art toy phenomenon sweeping from Bangkok to Beverly Hills wears a mischievous grin and pointy ears—and it was born in Hong Kong. Labubu, the elfin antihero created by Hong Kong illustrator Kasing Lung, has become the unlikely mascot of 21st-century pop culture, blending street art sensibilities with collector mania. What began as a niche character in Lung’s 2015 Nordic-inspired storybooks has exploded into a billion-dollar empire under Chinese retailer Pop Mart, proving Hong Kong’s enduring creative clout despite turbulent times.
Lung attributes his early creativity to childhood immersion in the works of legendary wuxia novelist Louis Cha Leung-yung (Jin Yong). Lung, who moved to Holland at six but maintained his Chinese literacy through dog-eared copies of Cha’s novels passed down by chefs in his parents’ restaurant, credits “The Smiling, Proud Wanderer” with sparking his imaginative worldbuilding. This literary foundation would later manifest in Labubu’s intricate Nordic mythology backstory—proof that Hong Kong’s cultural DNA travels well beyond its borders.
Labubu represents Hong Kong’s soft power at its most subversive—a sharp-toothed, gender-fluid creature that defies conventional cuteness. Unlike Japan’s expressionless Hello Kitty or America’s saccharine Care Bears, Labubu flaunts serrated teeth and a knowing smirk, its uneven eyes conveying playful anarchy. This deliberate imperfection strikes a chord in our era of curated Instagram perfection, offering adults permission to embrace their weirdness. The figures—produced in limited runs on high-quality vinyl—have become the ultimate affordable luxury, with rare variants trading for thousands on secondary markets.
Pop Mart’s genius lay in recognising Labubu’s potential as the perfect blind box candidate. The company’s signature opaque packaging turns each purchase into a thrilling gamble, with odds akin to pulling a rare Magic card. A standard series contains six common figures and one ultra-rare “secret” version—a strategy that has collectors buying entire cases in pursuit of exclusivity. This clever commerce model propelled Pop Mart’s valuation past $15 billion, with Labubu driving nearly 40% of sales. The numbers astonish: during 2024’s Singles’ Day sale, Pop Mart sold 1.8 million Labubu units in 90 minutes.
Celebrity endorsements lit the fuse. When Blackpink’s Lisa posted an Instagram story cradling a giant Labubu plush in 2024, Southeast Asia went berserk. Almost overnight, Vietnamese Facebook fan groups swelled to 240,000 members, while Thai fans queued for 48 hours outside Pop Mart’s Bangkok flagship. The toy became a paradoxical status symbol—Louis Vuitton-clad celebrities like Vietnamese model Thanh Hằng accessorised with $20 Labubu keychains, bridging luxury and street culture. Even politicians got in on the act: Singaporean MP Lam Pin Min brandished a Labubu dressed in his party colours during community outreach.
Behind the hype lies Hong Kong’s distinctive creative DNA. Lung’s designs channel the city’s subversive spirit—part manga mischief, part British absurdist humor, with a dash of Kowloon’s gritty neon aesthetic. The backstory paints Labubu as a well-intentioned troublemaker, accidentally wreaking havoc while trying to help—an apt metaphor for Hong Kong itself. This narrative depth separates art toys from conventional playthings; collectors don’t just own Labubu—they identify with its chaotic energy.
The commercial ecosystem surrounding Labubu reveals Hong Kong’s adaptability. While manufacturing happens across the border, design and IP management remain firmly rooted in the city. Pop Mart’s collaborations—from Harry Potter to Puma—showcase Hong Kong’s knack for bridging East and West. Limited edition drops sell out globally within minutes, with Hong Kong servers handling the digital stampede. Even the secondary market thrives here, with specialist forums like ToyZoneHK becoming trading hubs for rare variants.
Some dismiss art toys as speculative bubbles, but Labubu’s staying power suggests otherwise. Unlike Beanie Babies or Furbies, these figures tap into adult nostalgia and artistic appreciation. Hong Kong’s museums now feature designer toy exhibitions, while auction houses like Phillips host dedicated sales—a 2023 Labubu “Zombie” prototype fetched $28,000. The city has effectively elevated vinyl figures into legitimate contemporary art.
As geopolitical winds shift, Labubu offers Hong Kong a lesson in soft power. While politicians spar, culture flows freely—Pop Mart’s Ho Chi Minh City store displays Labubu alongside local artists’ works, fostering cross-border creativity. The toys have become unlikely diplomats; when Thailand’s tourism authority featured Labubu touring Bangkok landmarks, it sparked a 30% surge in Hong Kong visitors.
Looking ahead, Labubu’s test will be sustaining relevance beyond the hype cycle. Pop Mart is betting on narrative expansion, developing animated shorts and AR experiences to deepen emotional connections. Collaborations with digital artists hint at NFT ventures, while theme park rumors persist. Through it all, the brand stays rooted in Hong Kong’s irreverent spirit—because ultimately, Labubu’s magic lies in that knowing smirk, reminding us all not to take life too seriously.","[{'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'majority_ownership', 'tail': 'Labubu'}, {'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'CEO', 'tail': 'Kasing Lung'}]","['lam pin min', 'pop mart', 'lung', 'kitty', 'furbies', 'proud wanderer', 'instagram', 'blackpink’s lisa', 'louis cha leung-yung', 'labubu', 'kasing lung', 'lung’s 2015', 'thanh hằng', 'beanie babies', 'kowloon', 'harry potter', 'nft', 'pop mart’s bangkok', 'jin yong', 'care bears', 'phillips', 'louis vuitton-clad', 'magic', 'labubu “zombie”', 'pop mart’s', 'ar', 'ho chi minh city', 'ip']","- Labubu, created by Hong Kong illustrator Kasing Lung, has evolved from a niche character in 2015 to a billion-dollar enterprise under Pop Mart, driving nearly 40% of the company's sales.

This study aims to scientifically assess the impact of street space design on the psychological healing effect of users. Using Electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking technology, we focus on two core design elements, street interface type and green ratings, and use physiological indicators to quantify the healing response of users. Experimental results show that street interface type and green ratings (i.e., the proportion of green plants in the field of view) are two key factors influencing the healing properties of the street, and analysis of the EEG data reveals that street scenes under open space interface and high green ratings conditions have a better healing effect on the subjects because the former reduces the cognitive load, and the latter provides positive stimulation from natural elements. Eye-tracking data revealed the distribution of subjects' visual attention to different street scenes, and it was found that green ratings may have a greater influence on the healing effect than the type of street interface, probably because green ratings directly determines the richness of natural elements, which in turn has a more significant effect on the psyche. The subjective questionnaire, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of the dimensions of being away and extent in the study of street healing, suggesting that street design should focus on providing differentiation from everyday life and spatial expansiveness. The experimental results not only establish the validity of EEG and eye-tracking techniques in the assessment of street space healing, but also propose a scientific evaluation framework that integrates users' physiological and emotional responses. The proposed methodology provides an empirical basis for the improvement and optimization of the healing design of street spaces and enhances the relevance and effectiveness of design interventions.

View PricingPop Mart Increases Labubu Prices and Shifts Production to Vietnam
Chinese trend-toy maker Pop Mart has announced a price increase for its popular Labubu character in the US and is relocating more production to Vietnam. This strategic decision comes as the ongoing tariff tensions between the US and China continue to pressure profit margins. For more details, see the original report.
The Beijing-based company is set to launch Labubu 3.0, a vibrant collection of seven figurines inspired by Norse mythology, globally on Thursday. In mainland China, the new collection will be priced at 99 yuan (US$13.50), matching the resale price of previous versions. However, in the US, consumers will experience a price jump to US$28, up from US$22 for the previous series, as Pop Mart aims to safeguard its margins, according to a report by Jefferies.
Richard Lin, chief consumer analyst at SPDB International, noted that Pop Mart is positioned as a high-end toy brand overseas, primarily targeting adult buyers. ""Given this context, it has significant leverage in setting its prices,"" Lin stated. He also mentioned that Pop Mart might consider increasing prices on existing collections if tariffs significantly impact costs. ""Otherwise, the company won't be able to cover the additional expenses,"" he added.
Data from the IndexBox platform indicates that the toy market is experiencing shifts due to geopolitical tensions, with companies like Pop Mart adapting their strategies to maintain profitability.

Pop Mart,Pop Mart prices Labubu 3.0 collection at 99 yuan each - South China Morning Post,2025-04-24 04:03:30,"China’s Pop Mart exercises pricing power as Labubu popularity surges abroad
Company raises prices in US and moves more production to Vietnam to combat margin pressure amid tariff uncertainty
Chinese trend-toy maker Pop Mart is hiking prices on its popular Labubu character in the US and shifting more production to Vietnam, as the tariff war between the world’s two largest economies weighs on its profit margins.
The Beijing-based company will introduce Labubu 3.0, a colourful set of seven figurines from the Norse mythology-inspired “The Monsters” series, globally on Thursday.
Items in the new collection will be priced at 99 yuan (US$13.50) in mainland China, on par with the current resale price of previous iterations. Meanwhile, US consumers will see a notable price bump to US$28, up from US$22 for the previous series, as the company seeks to protect its margins, according to a Wednesday report by Jefferies.
“Pop Mart is already positioned as a high-end toy brand overseas and primarily targets adult buyers,” said Richard Lin, chief consumer analyst at SPDB International, a Hong Kong-based investment bank. “So given this context, it has a lot of say when it comes to determining its prices.”
Lin added that Pop Mart could also raise the prices of existing collections later if the tariffs have a significant impact. “Otherwise, the company won’t be able to cover the additional costs,” he said.","[{'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'chief_consumer_analyst', 'tail': 'Richard Lin'}]","['labubu', 'labubu 3.0', 'pop mart', 'spdb international', 'lin', 'norse', 'richard lin']","- Pop Mart is increasing prices for its Labubu character in the US from $22 to $28 amid tariff uncertainties affecting profit margins.

Chinasoft International,retail investors who own 49% along with institutions invested in Chinasoft International Limited (HKG:354) saw increase in their holdings value last week - simplywall.st,2025-04-24 01:41:26,"retail investors who own 49% along with institutions invested in Chinasoft International Limited (HKG:354) saw increase in their holdings value last week
Key Insights
- Chinasoft International's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public
- A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 49% ownership
- 27% of Chinasoft International is held by Institutions
A look at the shareholders of Chinasoft International Limited (HKG:354) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Following a 4.3% increase in the stock price last week, retail investors profited the most, but institutions who own 27% stock also stood to gain from the increase.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Chinasoft International, beginning with the chart below.
Check out our latest analysis for Chinasoft International
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Chinasoft International?
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Chinasoft International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Chinasoft International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Chinasoft International is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Dan Capital Management Ltd. is the largest shareholder with 14% of shares outstanding. Yuhong Chen is the second largest shareholder owning 9.2% of common stock, and UBS Asset Management AG holds about 6.5% of the company stock. Yuhong Chen, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
Insider Ownership Of Chinasoft International
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Chinasoft International Limited. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own HK$1.2b worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
With a 49% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Chinasoft International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
Private Equity Ownership
With a stake of 14%, private equity firms could influence the Chinasoft International board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.
Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.
But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Tech war: Shanghai chip firm doubles quarterly profit as China expands supply chain role
Semiconductor design firm Montage Technology is currently one of the world’s three main suppliers of connector chips to the DRAM market
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
Chinese semiconductor company Montage Technology reported a sharp surge in revenue and profit in the March quarter, following a significant rise a year earlier, in a sign of the country’s expanding presence in the memory chip segment.

The Shanghai-based integrated circuit design firm, which supplies connectors to dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, said in a filing on Wednesday that its first-quarter revenue reached 1.21 billion yuan (US$166 million), up 65.78 per cent year on year. Net profit jumped 135.14 per cent to 525 million yuan from 223 million yuan a year ago.
Montage attributed its strong growth last quarter to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, as demand rose for DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5) DRAM chips used in high-performance computing systems and data centres. Shipments of both its DDR5 and RCD (Register Clock Driver) chips have grown substantially, the company said on Wednesday.
Montage is currently one of the world’s three main suppliers of DDR5 connector chips, along with Japan’s Renesas Electronics and US-based Rambus. Most clients of Montage are from outside China, according to its 2024 annual report.
That reflects China’s growing presence in the global semiconductor supply chain, despite US tech restrictions.

China’s top DRAM manufacturer, ChangXin Memory Technologies, on Wednesday issued a rare recruitment announcement for its Japanese subsidiary, as the company aims to take on SK Hynix, Samsung Electronics and Micron Technology in the global market.

Pop Mart,"Pop Mart eyes bigger slice of the Philippines with creative collaborations, DTI says - Marketing-Interactive",2025-04-22 16:10:07,"Pop Mart eyes bigger slice of the Philippines with creative collaborations, DTI says
share on
Beijing-headquartered designer toy giant Pop Mart International Group is gearing up for a deeper push into the Philippine market, eyeing new retail locations and local creative partnerships as part of its 2025 expansion strategy.
According to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Pop Mart vice president Karen Chen outlined the company's development plans in a recent engagement with key Philippine agencies and stakeholders.
""These plans involve forging partnerships with local business enterprises, and expanding their physical presence through new store openings,"" DTI said in a statement.
Don't miss: Pop Mart plans to take legal action against unauthorised use of Labubu
Pop Mart, known globally for its highly stylised collectible characters such as MOLLY, DIMOO, SKULLPANDA, and THE MONSTERS, currently operates two pop-up outlets in the country — one in SM Makati and another in SM Mall of Asia. However, the brand appears ready to go beyond pop-ups, as it explores more permanent and widespread retail footprints in the region.
During a business mission to Manila on 10 April, Pop Mart executives met with the Philippine Franchise Association and key government agencies including the Board of Investments, the Design Centre of the Philippines, and the Intellectual Property Office. The sessions, facilitated by DTI's Philippine Trade and Investment Centre in Beijing and the Foreign Trade Service Corps, centred on navigating regulatory frameworks, market entry, and the intricacies of intellectual property protection.
A standout point in the discussions was Pop Mart's enthusiasm for tapping into the local creative ecosystem. ""Specifically, the company conveyed a strong interest in working with Filipino creatives to develop new intellectual property and original designs,"" the DTI noted.
The toy firm hopes to produce collectibles ""deeply inspired"" by Filipino culture, marking a shift from mere product rollout to meaningful cultural engagement — a strategy that could resonate strongly with today's experience-driven consumers.
This local push builds on Pop Mart's strong financials in 2024, when it posted a 106.9% jump in revenue to 13 billion yuan (US$1.8 billion) and a 185.9% rise in net profit to 3.4 billion yuan (US$465 million). The Southeast Asian region was a key contributor to this growth, with the DTI reporting a ""sixfold increase"" in revenue.
""The company aims to leverage its strong brand recognition and loyal customer base, driven by the popularity of plush toys and an aggressive overseas market expansion, particularly in Southeast Asia,"" DTI added. Beyond the Philippines, Pop Mart has expanded across Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, where it recently opened its largest store in the country at Kota Kasablanka Mall.
Globally, Pop Mart boasts over 500 stores across more than 30 countries and regions. Its offerings span beyond designer toys to include theme parks, digital entertainment, and an IP incubation and operations arm.

Montage Technology,CDNS Powers AI Memory With Industry-First DDR5 12.8Gbps MRDIMM Gen2 IP - TradingView,2025-04-22 13:18:00,"CDNS Powers AI Memory With Industry-First DDR5 12.8Gbps MRDIMM Gen2 IP
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. CDNS recently launched the industry’s first DDR5 12.8Gbps MRDIMM Gen2 memory IP system solution, designed on the advanced TSMC N3 process node. This leading-edge memory solution is poised to address the skyrocketing demand for memory bandwidth fueled by the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), high-performance computing (HPC) and enterprise data processing workloads.
Delivering a robust 12.8Gbps data rate, it effectively doubles the bandwidth of standard DDR5 6400Mbps DRAM, making significant advancements in memory technology, while maintaining industry-leading RAS and ultra-low latency encryption features. Cadence DDR5 MRDIMM Gen2 system incorporates a complete memory subsystem—an integrated PHY and controller, thoroughly validated in hardware using Gen2 MRDIMM modules. These elements form a full, scalable memory subsystem, enabling AI chips, server processors and data center SoCs to unlock next-gen memory bandwidth and performance.
This cutting-edge memory IP has already been deployed in multiple customer engagements, spanning top-tier AI, HPC and data center solution providers. Cadence’s new initiative highlights collaborations with Micron and Montage Technology, emphasizing a comprehensive ecosystem approach.
Micron’s industry-first 1-gamma (1γ) DRAM offers higher density, reliability and performance tailored for AI/ML and HPC workloads. Montage Technology delivers memory buffer chips (MRCD02/MDB02) capable of 12.8Gbps speeds, essential for realizing the full potential of MRDIMM modules. These collaborations ensure interoperability and system-level performance for customers seeking to leverage the DDR5 MRDIMM Gen2 standard in high-throughput environments.

It continues to invest heavily in verification and digital design products, which are helping it to launch products that address the ever-growing needs of electronics and semiconductor companies. The company’s verification business is gaining traction due to the rising complexity of system verification and software bring-up.
However, the company faces challenges, including growing competition, risks associated with its global operations, a substantial amount of goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet, and a high level of debt.

Sirio Pharma,"Across the Nutraverse: The Vitamin Shoppe acquisition, plant cell culture investments, Sirio’s new longevity lab - NutraIngredients.com",2025-04-21 13:29:21,"This week’s big news across the global nutrition and supplements industries includes the acquisition of The Vitamin Shoppe, Green Bioactives’ new funds from Scottish Enterprise and Sirio Pharma’s new Shanghai-based longevity lab.
Private equity firms to acquire The Vitamin Shoppe
Kingswood Capital Management and Performance Investment Partners announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement through which an affiliate will acquire The Vitamin Shoppe from Franchise Group.
“We are excited to partner with The Vitamin Shoppe team and help them build upon the success the business has enjoyed over the last 48 years,” Kingswood Partner Michael Niegsch and PIP Partner Mark Genender shared in a joint statement.
“We plan to make significant investments in the company’s third-party brand relationships, research and development across The Vitamin Shoppe’s owned proprietary brand portfolio, upgrades to the store fleet and improvements to the omni-channel digital platform to deliver the best possible experience to customers.”
Details of the transaction, which is expected to close later in the second quarter of this year pending a bankruptcy judge’s approval, were not disclosed. Bloomberg Law reported the cost of the deal at $193.5 million.
Green Bioactives secures £1.1 million grant for plant cell culture platform
Edinburgh-based Green Bioactives announced it had secured a grant of up to £1.1 million from Scottish Enterprise to support an 18-month research and development initiative focused on the production and initial scale-up of natural products that are derived from plant cell culture.
The company focuses on developing natural plant-based wellness ingredients by collecting plant samples, cleaning and cultivating stem cells, and scaling production in bioreactors to extract beneficial compounds.
“Over the next two years—particularly during the 18-month span of this grant—we plan to scale up our production,” Chris Meaney, chief business officer at Green Bioactives, told NutraIngredients. “But rather than jumping straight to a much larger 1,000-liter reactor, which would involve an entirely new set of challenges and a steep learning curve, we’ve chosen a more modular approach.”
“We’re not trying to replace bulk commodities, we’re working with high-value ingredients, and by running several 50-liter systems in parallel, we’ll be able to start selling products into the market and servicing customers much sooner.”
Sirio Pharma sets up longevity lab in Shanghai
Sirio Pharma is doubling down efforts on anti-aging and longevity science research, setting up an internal lab within its Shanghai R&D center and expecting to launch products co-developed with clients and external institutions later this year.
The internal lab comprises a specialized team that focuses on aging research and how novel ingredients could be used to develop synergistic formulations and products for supporting anti-aging and healthy longevity.
The aging research will target four key areas, namely cellular health, probiotics and gut health, muscle health and the reproductive system.
More specifically, the research will look at enhancing cellular health, the role of probiotics in reducing the aging process and the development of novel supplement formulations to address muscle loss and ovary functional decline during aging.
Research will also be conducted to find out the biological mechanisms of aging and how they can be modulated.
“While most of the research will be conducted in China, we will also collaborate with research institutions worldwide, leveraging Sirio’s existing global R&D infrastructure to explore new bioactive ingredients, formulations, and scientific validation methods,” said Dr. Youyou Zhao, assistant vice president and global head of research and development at Sirio Pharma.","[{'head': 'Kingswood Capital Management', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'acquisition', 'tail': 'The Vitamin Shoppe'}, {'head': 'Performance Investment Partners', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'acquisition', 'tail': 'The Vitamin Shoppe'}, {'head': 'Green Bioactives', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'chief_business_officer', 'tail': 'Chris Meaney'}, {'head': 'Sirio Pharma', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'assistant_vice_president', 'tail': 'Youyou Zhao'}]","['sirio pharma', 'michael niegsch', 'franchise group', 'kingswood', 'bloomberg law', 'sirio pharma’s', 'scottish enterprise', 'youyou zhao', 'chris meaney', 'the vitamin shoppe', 'nutraingredients', 'mark genender', 'kingswood capital management and performance investment partners', 'sirio']","- Kingswood Capital Management and Performance Investment Partners plan to acquire The Vitamin Shoppe for $193.5 million, pending bankruptcy judge approval.

Pop Mart,Found on celebrity bags and on TikTok: The Labubu toy doll fashionistas are loving - BBC,2025-04-20 00:47:06,"Found on celebrity bags and in viral videos: The toy fashionistas are loving
James' reaction as he unboxes a rare, limited edition Labubu toy can only be described as pure, unadulterated joy.
The YouTuber delightedly holds up a brown plush monster, which has been described by collectors as ""cute"", ""ugly"", ""creepy"" and everything in between.
Labubus are furry snaggletoothed gremlins, which are designed by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung and sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.
They're almost always sold out online and long queues often form outside the selected shops that stock them.
Labubus are also primarily sold in the blind box format, meaning customers never know what version they'll get until they open them - a fact collectors have said adds to their appeal.
While it's difficult to pin their recent rise in popularity to one particular ingredient, celebrity endorsement, social media unboxing videos and their ability to stir up nostalgia are all contributing factors.
James Welsh, from Hampshire, sees his Labubu collectable as an investment, which he tells the BBC ""could probably earn a fair bit of money two or three years down the line"".
He has just shy of 30 Labubus which retail at around £25 for an individual toy or £153 for a box of six.
He says he has ""spent hundreds and hundreds but not quite thousands"" on the dolls.
Labubu maker Pop Mart has doubled its profits in the last year and is eying up global expansion in 2025.
The company, which started 15 years ago, has been described as ""elevating toy buying to an act of trendy connoisseurship"" and praised for embracing non-traditional designs, which have made them a hit with collectors.
Artist Kasing Lung is behind some of their popular toys including The Monsters series and Labubu.
He credits living in The Netherlands as the inspiration behind the dolls and told Hypbeast ""I liked to read storybooks and was influenced by ancient European elf legends"".
Lung added that during his childhood, ""there were no game consoles or computers, so I had to draw dolls with a pen, so I had the idea of painting fairy tales since I was a child"".
He first came up with the designs in 2015 and signed a licensing agreement with Pop Mart in 2019 to make them into toys.
Labubu as a name has no specific meaning, it is a fictional character based around an elf-like creature.
James says his first thought when he saw the one of the toys was, ""they're creepy but they're also really cute and I need as many of them as I can get, I need them in every colour"".
The 36-year-old adds, ""I think they [provide] some real escapism for millennials as it's like reverting back to your youth with these toys and collectables.""
A former stylist, he now primarily creates beauty and skincare content, but has recently gained thousands of views on his channel from Labubu unboxing videos.
He tells the BBC: ""there is a strong link between these plush pendants and the fashion community as well.""
""They're a way to express who you are, you can show that through the different characters, which add a pop of colour and fashion is fun, it's not serious at the end of the day, it's reflective of who you are.""
There are several iterations of Labubu - from vinyl figures to plush toys - but the keychain versions have become most popular recently.
Labubu's ascent into mainstream culture has been steady - but was elevated last year by BLACKPINK star Lisa.
The K-pop singer was seen with a Labubu creature hanging from her handbag and also called the toys ""her secret obsession"" in an interview.
Rihanna was also spotted with one of the toys attached to her bag in recent weeks, which has led to fashion fans replicating her look.
But for collectors such as 22-year-old Chulie, who shares her purchases on TikTok, she says Labubu becoming a ""fashion trend"" misses the point of why they're so loved.
""For me, it's all about the nostalgia and the surprise aspect,"" she tells the BBC.
One of Pop Mart's biggest selling points for collectors is the way their toys are packaged in what's known as blind boxes, which make the experience of getting one like a lucky dip.
You don't know what character you are getting until you unseal the package, so it's always a gamble for collectors.
""You know it's fun, it's a dopamine hit"", James says.
""It's gambling for some of us - kind of like a happy meal, you don't know what toy you're getting until you open it up.""
It also makes the toy perfect for the world of social media, as creators can catch their genuine surprise on camera and share it with other fans - something James says provides comfort and ""escapism from the real world"".
Chulie says, as a child, she would collect Pokemon trading cards, so collecting another surprise item ""triggered memories for me"".
""When you're having a rough time, especially for me personally, it's a big serotonin boost to not only buy a collectable and keep it, but share the experience with other people as well,"" she adds.
Others have compared Labubus to Beanie Babies, which were popular in the 1990s and 2000s, and say collecting Labubus evokes feelings of childhood nostalgia.
For some fans, just documenting the experience of getting a Labubu is a talking point, with many showing the long queues and hours of research required to find out where new collections are being stocked.
It's prompted backlash on some social media channels, with users criticising collectors that have bought large numbers of items.
""Just because you don't understand someone's hobby, doesn't mean it's not valid in any way,"" James says.
While James hasn't spent hours and hours queuing to build his collection, he says he ""has gone out of my way"" to source authentic dolls online. As with any popular item, counterfeits have made their way onto the market.
""I spend a fair bit of money on my hobby, but it's my adult money,"" he jokes.
Chulie says she currently has 10 Labubus, but has sold some to other fans when she's ended up with the same toy twice.
""When I first got exposed to them, I wasn't sure why people were spending money on them, because in the US they start at around $21 [£16], which is minimum wage for a lot of people.
""But it's so addictive getting one, and it's really hard to stop buying once you start,"" she adds.","[{'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'licensing_agreement', 'tail': 'Kasing Lung'}]","['pop mart', 'lung', 'pokemon', ""pop mart's"", 'youtuber', 'labubu', 'kasing lung', 'james welsh', 'labubus', 'rihanna', 'beanie babies', 'blackpink star', 'lisa', 'bbc', 'hypbeast', 'bbc found', 'chulie', 'tiktok', 'james']","- Labubu toys, designed by Kasing Lung and produced by Pop Mart, are gaining popularity for their unique designs and blind box sales format, leading to high collector demand.

Pop Mart,Black Panther and More Marvel Heroes Board Disney Cruise Line’s Destiny for Avengers Experiences - Gizmodo,2025-04-18 22:30:13,"This week Disney Cruises revealed more looks at its new Disney Destiny and just how big Marvel’s presence will be for MCU fans of all ages once sailings start later this year. Fan favorites Black Panther and Spider-Man will be making appearances alongside a trickster villain variant Loki. And as far as Marvel experiences go we’re looking forward to the Sanctum, a lounge bar inspired by the offices of one Doctor Strange.
Also this week: Universal Studios Hollywood’s Fan Fest Nights outlined how cosplay will work at the event for fans of Star Trek, Wicked, One Piece, and Dungeons & Dragons, among the fandoms represented. As more Pop Mart and Robo Shop locations spring up, Labubu is set to debut a new colorful drop with “Big Into Energy” nationwide. Plus Sinners hits theaters and we have a guide to finding venues screening Ryan Coogler’s latest as it’s meant to be seen.
Black Panther leads the Avengers aboard the Disney Destiny
Disney Imagineering gave a look at the process for the incredible Black Panther statue being built for the atrium of Disney Cruise Line’s latest ship, the Disney Destiny. It’s themed to heroes and villains, so it makes sense to have Black Panther front and center to greet cruisers. It also features Spider-Man on the stern. There will be a huge MCU presence aboard this ship for kids and adult superhero fanatics.
Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum… as a bar
Here’s a look at some of the libations that will be featured in the Disney Destiny‘s Sanctum lounge, which like the themed bars on other Disney ships inspired by Star Wars and The Haunted Mansion will include deep immersive elements as part of the experience. The space will resemble Strange’s office and we wonder if there will be a bar top effect where your beer gets refilled just like Thor’s did in the movies.
Meet superhero Minnie alongside Marvel faves
Can we talk about how this is a really fierce look for Superhero Minnie? It’s almost like she’s a part of the Marvels line up and a picture with her, Carol, Kamala, and Monica would be amazing. As far as actual MCU characters confirmed to be on the Disney Destiny, expect to meet Spider-Man and Black Panther with more announcements to come.
Heroic Bites with Edna Á La Mode Sweets and Marvel Dining
The Incredibles get a perfectly named treat stop inspired by the iconic Edna Mode, and there better be ice cream á la mode with no capes because it’s what Edna would want. And it appears that’s a high possibility with a menu that boasts handmade gelato, ice cream, and more along with specialty treats prepped from Edna Mode’s lab. We see those suited up Incredibles cupcakes and look forward to a ton of Jack-Jack Cookie Num Nums.
And as previously featured aboard other cruises, the Worlds of Marvel dining experience will also be offered aboard the Disney Destiny, with a Groot and Rocket takeover. Guests can expect an awesome mix of food and superhero antics courtesy of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Coachella gets geeky with Rock Opera Gaga, L.A. Phil, and Yo Gabba Gabba!
If you’re venturing out to the desert and happen to also be a nerd, we hope to see you via livestream at Yo Gabba Gabba!‘s set, which will feature Paul Williams and Weird Al for an encore of their “Rainbow Connection” remix with Portugal the Man. Cinema fans will also enjoy Gustavo Dudamel and the LA Phil performing Star Wars scores. And as probably the most gothic horror camp headliner ever, Lady Gaga is going to unleash more rock opera goods. If you’re going to be in that crowd or really any be sure to keep your ear drums safe with plugs like Loop, which kept ours safe when we went a couple years ago. This year we’ll be tuned in to Coachella live on YouTube.

Meet The Wizard of Oz’s Dorothy Gale and Glinda in Abu Dhabi
From April 5 through May 11 you can meet The Wizard of Oz‘s Glinda and Dorothy at WB World at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. It’s a truly unique experience as we do not have a Warner Bros. park in the states that can use its version of the Oz witches in parks unless Six Flags pulls a bold move. Nevertheless this show includes Dorothy performing “Over the Rainbow” which is really neat.

Pop Mart,A Vibrant New Collection of Pop Mart's Viral Labubu Bag Charms Is Dropping Soon — Here’s When to Shop - SheKnows,2025-04-18 15:00:00,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.
I’m not sure about you, but I can’t go anywhere without spotting one of those fluffy little monsters hanging off someone’s bag — sometimes even more than one! It’s no secret that bag charms are the “It” accessory for teens and young adults, especially plushie bag charms. Although there’s no shortage of options available, there’s one in particular that’s still highly coveted to this day: Labubus. If you’re a fan, there’s a brand new collection dropping and you’ll want to get your hands on it ASAP.
In case you aren’t familiar, Labubu is a character from Pop Mart’s THE MONSTERS series. She’s soft, she’s fluffy, she’s plush, and she has a mischievous look on her face that makes her super cute (or also somewhat terrifying to some). These iconic bag charms became popular in Asia (Lisa from Blackpink is known for being a fan!) before spreading worldwide. They’re so highly coveted, Pop Mart stores and vending machines (also known as their Robo shops) can barely keep them in stock. I’ve witnessed long lines of people just waiting at a vending machine for these to restock. Plus, every time I go into a Pop Mart store, without fail someone always asks about Labubus and the answer is always the same.
If you have yet to get a Labubu bag charm of your own, there’s great news. A brand new collection is dropping and it’s their most colorful (and in my opinion, cutest) yet! THE MONSTERS’ Big Into Energy vinyl plush collection features six adorable pendants that are vibrant in color. Per the brand’s press release, it’s an “emotionally rich collection” that captures the “spectrum of energies we experience in daily life.”
What to Expect From THE MONSTERS Big Into Energy Collection
Each Labubu plushie represents one of six energies: Love, Hope, Serenity, Luck, Happiness, and Loyalty. Per Pop Mart, the meanings are as follows:
Love: A warm and tender presence that fills our hearts.
Hope: A guiding light that pushes us forward.
Serenity: A calm and peaceful essence.
Luck: A charm for positivity and good fortune.
Happiness: A radiant joy that uplifts the spirit.
Loyalty: A steadfast and true connection.
And of course, there’s always a super secret one included in the collection as well, which features all the colors. They all have painted toes, and tie-dye-like fur, with matching colored eyes and noses. From the look of it, these have the same fluffy-soft fur of the Have a Seat collection, which many are excited about. I personally love the meaning behind each plush, it makes you feel like you’re carrying around a lucky charm all day. As always, these are all blind boxes, so you never know which one you’re going to get.
When Does the New Labubu Big Into Energy Collection Drop?
THE MONSTERS’ Big Into Energy vinyl plush blind boxes are set to drop on April 25 at Pop Mart stores. However, if you want to shop online, Pop Mart’s website says it will launch on their website on April 24 at 7 p.m. PT/10 p.m. ET. Pop Mart also has a shop on Amazon where they do release products, and we confirmed that the Labubu Big Into Energy blind boxes will be available to shop starting Friday, April 25. You’ll have to keep an eye on it and act fast though. Unsurprisingly, these tend to go super quick on Amazon and then you’ll likely be redirected to a re-seller. However, since it is not a limited-edition release, Pop Mart will be re-stocking these. Speaking of re-sellers, you can also try your luck at StockX. As of now, it looks like there are already plushies being sold.
So, ready to see what the new Labubu Big Into Energy collection looks like? Check the new plushies out below, including the super secret one!
As a reminder, the Labubu vinyl plushie bag charms are super, super popular. There’s a very good chance these will sell out FAST. Be sure to keep an eye out for any updates from us or bookmark this page so you’re ready to go on April 24. It’s guaranteed to drop on Pop Mart’s official site and likely Amazon shortly after.

Pop Mart,Labubu Just Became the Fashion Girl’s Favorite Plus-One (With a New Collection Soon) - Who What Wear,2025-04-18 14:15:34,"Labubu Just Became the Fashion Girl’s Favorite Plus-One (With a New Collection Soon)
If you've seen a freaky little creature nestled on the crook of your favorite influencer's arm, you're not alone. 2025's biggest trend isn't court shoes or powder pink—it's Labubu. If you aren't familiar with the name, you will be soon: this viral plushie bag charm has taken the internet by storm over the last few months, with celebrities like Rihanna and Lisa of Blackpink clipping the POP MART original creature onto the handles of their Louis Vuitton and Khaite bags.
For those who have been aiming to steal their look, it feels like it's been harder than ever to acquire a Labubu—even more so than to get offered a mystical Mini Kelly—with POP MART stores and vending machines often selling out within minutes. Good things come to those who wait, though, and Who What Wear can exclusively confirm that a new Labubu collection is around the corner. Huge news for the fashion girlies!
Launching April 25, The Big Into Energy bag charm blind box series features six of the viral furry Labubu bag charms (and an additional secret color way) donned up in a whimsical ombré color way, a first for the The Monsters series, created by Kasing Lung. The theme, Kasing explained to Who What Wear, is all about revealing a softer, more expressive side—both for the actual Labubu character and for the person wearing her.
""With Big Into Energy, I wanted to explore how emotions take shape in color and form—the quiet power of hope, the warmth of love, the boldness of happiness,"" Lung exclusively told Who What Wear. ""Each piece is meant to carry a feeling, like a little charm you wear to remind yourself of who you are or what you need that day. It’s a way to bring art and emotion into everyday life— playful, personal, and full of meaning.""
Clearly, from Khaite to Prada, no bag is too fancy for Labubu. Unlike funky, eclectic bag charms, handbag plushies are rooted in childlike wonder rather than a desire to appear like your life is curated, yet effortless. When the state of the world is in shambles, egg prices are rising every day, and shopping is getting more expensive by the minute, what's the harm in throwing a freaky little woodland creature onto your bag?
There’s something unexpectedly charming about pairing the elegance of high fashion with the playful innocence of a plushie. These little charms do more than decorate a bag—they bring a sense of warmth and personality. A tiny Labubu hanging from a designer tote softens the overall look, making luxury feel more down-to-earth, more approachable. It’s a quiet reminder that fashion can be both stylish and a little bit fun.
Below, shop all of the handbags we're eyeing to latch our new Labubus onto. The POP MART: The Monsters Big Into Energy collection will release online and in-store on April 25.
How to Wear a Labubu Bag Charm
How to style: grab your favorite statement-colored mini bag and your favorite Labubu to take for a spin.
How to style: East-west bags have been our team's latest obsession for the last few months, so it's no surprise to see other It Girls take up the silhoutte when it comes to styling their Labubus.
How to style: Play with hardware details, like buckles, to transform your bag from basic to beloved, along with your go-to Labubu bag charm.
How to style: Texture play is key when it comes to elevating a handbag, so go for a style that features a suede of faux-suede feel to contrast against your favorite Labubu's furry look.

Pop Mart,Thieves steal £150k worth of Pop Mart toys - Yahoo,2025-04-18 13:53:39,"Thieves steal £150k worth of Pop Mart toys
Thieves have stolen £150,000 worth of Pop Mart toys.
A shipment of the viral toy Hirono was intercepted by thieves in the early hours of April 8 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, just weeks before they were to be released to UK shops.
The crime is the second in a month targeting expensive toys, after £20,000 worth of Jellycat stuffed animals were stolen from an independent store in Cheddar, Somerset, on March 30.
Criminal groups are becoming increasingly aware of the collectable toy market, experts warn, because of the prices these figurines fetch online.
Hirono, a small plastic figurine that resembles a small boy in a range of different costumes, was set to go on sale in May.
Pop Mart also makes Labubu, figurines that resemble monsters, which are loved by celebrities, including former Love Islander Olivia Atwood, who posted a video unboxing one.
Dua Lipa and Rihanna are also known to enjoy the toys, designed by Hong Kong-based artist Kasing Lung.
The toys retail from £30 but have sold on eBay for as much as £1,000. The most valuable is the £164 Monsters Zimono I Found You doll, according to the Pop Mart website.
A spokesman for Pop Mart said he was “deeply saddened” by the “recent rise in toy theft”, adding that he was “working diligently” to ensure it didn’t impact the launch next month.
A spokesman for Hertfordshire Constabulary said: “Police are investigating following a theft from a motor vehicle in Hemel Hempstead.

The Pop Mart toys, which are loved by celebs and members of the public alike, were swiped from a lorry just weeks before their official release.
Pop Mart make plastic figurines of loveable characters including the likes of Labubu, which has gone viral online.
A brand new series of figures named Hirono were due to hit shop shelves in May, but a major shipment of the toys, which are not yet available commercially, was intercepted by the thieves.
Criminals raided the lorry carrying some £150,000 worth of the toys in the early hours of April 8 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.
The criminals made off with the majority of the toys and Hertfordshire Constabulary are investigating.
Hirono - a small plastic figurine that resembles a small boy in a range of different costumes - is due to hit shelves online and in-store in May.
A spokesperson for Pop Mart said they are 'deeply saddened' by the 'recent rise in toy theft' and said it was 'working diligently' to ensure it didn't impact the launch next month.

The vast majority of the shipment was stolen - equating to £150,000 worth of stock
The crime is the second in a month targeting expensive toys.
Criminal groups are becoming increasingly aware of the booming collectible toy market, experts warn, because of the hefty prices they fetch online.
On March 30, £20k worth of Jellycat toys were stolen from an independent store in Cheddar, Somerset.
Jellycat plushies have been the target of multiple high-value thefts in recent months, leading some stores to resort to desperate measures to protect the stock, such as storing them in locked cabinets.
The theft in Cheddar saw a masked couple repeatedly reverse their car into a shopfront in the early hours of the morning, before making off with more than 300 soft toys.
Rare Jellycats can be sold for up to thousands of pounds online, fuelling a rise in the number of 'steal to sell' shoplifters operating around the country.
Paul Pimlott, company secretary of The Gorge Bear Company which was targeted in the burglary, said: 'We had over 300 soft toys stolen in the raid. We've been here since 1999 and nothing like this has happened before.
'But we've had lots of support from the community and we will continue.

'We also own World of Bears in Taunton and have staff to look after. So as a local business we want to carry on contributing locally.'

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Constabulary said: 'Police are investigating following a theft from a motor vehicle in Hemel Hempstead.
'Between 1.30am and 5.27am on Tuesday April 8, a trailer curtain was cut on an HGV parked on Eaton Road, causing extensive damage and a large number of items were reported stolen.

Montage Technology,Alphabet Spins Off ‘Moonshot’ Supply Chain Project - Supply Chain Brain,2025-04-17 14:28:22,"Visit Our Sponsors |
Alphabet, the company that owns Google, has made an independent company of its in-house project Chorus, which it says is focused on making the global supply chain more efficient, according to Business Insider.
Chorus, formally launched in March 2022, was formed inside Alphabet's famed X moonshot lab, which tries to make technological breakthroughs by pursuing hugely ambitious and often zany ideas. Chorus announced its independence in an April 15 statement, saying that Series X Capital led Chorus’ funding, “as the team scales its suite of AI driven orchestration tools to radically transform how we make, move, and manage the world’s goods.”
Chorus’ roots were in an earlier X moonshot project, Project Delta, that focused specifically on the global food supply chain, using AirTag and Bluetooth technology, among others. Its stated goal was “developing new sensor technology, software and machine learning tools to radically improve our real-time understanding of where physical goods are located, where they are needed, what state they are in, and how they are used.”
In March 2022, Swiss transportation giant Kuehne+Nagel announced a partnership with Chorus, with the goal of offering Kuehne+Nagel Road Logistics customers “real-time solutions and granular, prescriptive insights into the health and state of their global supply chain and logistics operations.”
""The next big milestones are making our visibility, condition monitoring and remote inventory management services generally available,"" Suresh Vishnubhatla, Chorus CEO, told Business Insider.
X — formerly Google X — has spun up projects such as Alphabet's self-driving company Waymo and its drone delivery business Wing.

Pop Mart,10 Minutes With … WildBrain on How Nostalgia and Innovation Drives Franchise Expansion - License Global,2025-04-17 07:00:00,"10 Minutes With … WildBrain on How Nostalgia and Innovation Drives Franchise Expansion10 Minutes With … WildBrain on How Nostalgia and Innovation Drives Franchise Expansion
License Global speaks with Erin Morris, vice president, global franchise strategy and retail, WildBrain about how the company is leveraging nostalgia, digital growth and strategic partnerships to expand the global footprint of brands like “Strawberry Shortcake” and “Teletubbies.”
License Global: You have been in your role at WildBrain for a few months now. How are you settling in and what are you enjoying most about the job?
Erin Morris: I love the family feeling that WildBrain has! Having been in leadership roles at incredible companies such as Disney, DreamWorks and Fox, I was privileged to work with close-knit teams at all of them, and WildBrain feels the same.
What is also exciting is the functional diversification of the business. With an award-winning animation studio, a highly sophisticated audience engagement team and a top-class global licensing agency, WildBrain CPLG, it feels like there’s nothing WildBrain can’t do that large studios can. But WildBrain has an advantage – our size. We are large enough to have global reach and impact, yet small enough to be nimble and agile, so innovation and entrepreneurship thrive and responses to changes in the market can be quickly implemented.
Erin Morris, WildBrain
Your core remit is planning and implementing global growth strategies for WildBrain franchises, including “Strawberry Shortcake” and “Teletubbies.” Can you give us an update on the latest licensing deals and collaborations for those properties and anything that has stood out for you in your first few months?
For both brands, we continue to be inspired by the heritage and fandom around these iconic characters. “Strawberry Shortcake’s” nostalgic appeal and continued growth amongst Gen Z audiences, has seen the launch of some very exciting licensing collaborations and retail partnerships, including the ultimate ‘80s throwback collaboration with Care Bears and our friends at Cloudco Entertainment. Fan reception to this brand mash-up has been extraordinary and we’re looking forward to debuting more products on shelves in the U.S. and Canada over the coming months. We also have another exciting brand collaboration launching in the fall, which is part of our ‘Berry Besties’ campaign kicking off in summer and running through fall and into spring 2026, so more to come on that soon. Additionally, our global expansion continues in key markets and we have an incredible program with Primark launching in the U.K. in May with Strawberry herself heading to London to celebrate.
For “Teletubbies,” we’re building on the global success of the brand celebrating its origins with an expanded licensing program targeting preschool kids and parents that will reach international markets. Our colorful quartet is also performing extremely well across Asia-Pacific with significant demand from fans of all ages, seen particularly in our stand-out global retail programs with POP MART and MINISO. We have also recently launched multiple licensing collaborations in both new and established categories, including a beauty collection with MISSHA in Korea and a fashion line with Cakeworthy in Toronto, which underscores the enduring global appeal of this much-loved franchise.
MISSHA x ""Teletubbies,"" WildBrain
Looking more generally at kids streaming trends, are there any licensed product categories that stand out at retail?
Nostalgia continues to be a key trend when it comes to licensed products. We’re seeing big content platforms really lean into classic kids’ content to bring in audiences and that’s backed up by how families today are choosing what they watch. Our recent research report with Savanta, exploring the evolving content-viewing habits of U.S. families, shows that nostalgia and familiarity are key drivers in decision making when it comes to content.
What would you say are the top three things that help drive fan engagement?
Digital engagement is a key area and one where we’re driving triple-digit growth for our brands. Strategically we’ve been focused on elevating our social footprint for both “Strawberry Shortcake” and “Teletubbies” with creative campaigns targeting our kidult fans, as well as young parents who have grown up with these brands and are now enjoying them with their children.
“Teletubbies” recently surpassed two million followers on TikTok with an engaged audience of over 29 million in the last year, up 180 per cent (YOY), and the brand is set to hit 1 million followers on Instagram in the next month, with fan engagement up 157 percent (YOY). “Strawberry Shortcake” is also seeing significant growth with followers up 98 percent in the last year on TikTok, and fan engagements on Instagram at a huge 23 million, up 308 percent (YOY).
For our young fans, YouTube and our bouquet of FAST channels around the world, including our recent expansion in Europe, have accelerated viewership of our content to new audiences. We’re excited to continue to grow our cross-platform presence globally, bringing kids’ and families content they know and love.

Focusing specifically on Licensing Expo, which is coming up next month. What IP will you be showcasing on your booth?
I’ve been at Licensing Expo just about every year since it was in New York, so that tells you how long I’ve been in the industry! I’m looking forward to seeing long-time friends and business partners, as well as building WildBrain’s owned IP into global evergreen franchises around the world.
“Strawberry Shortcake” and “Teletubbies” will be at the forefront of the showcase and we’re excited to unveil our plans and start bringing partners onboard for “Teletubbies” 30th anniversary in 2027. We’re also continuing to develop the international licensing program for the long-standing, preschool favorite “In the Night Garden.”
What are the opportunities and benefits of trade shows for you and what are you aiming to achieve at this year’s event?
Trade shows are valuable in that they provide a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in all aspects of the business and meet with dozens of partners and potential partners all in one week. It’s a great opportunity to share new initiatives such as our Berry Besties campaign and get partners excited for future opportunities such as “Teletubbies” 30th anniversary, as well as discover innovative new companies and keep abreast of trends. I also like to see what the competition is up to as it helps me keep my strategy sharp and stay ahead of the game!
Care Bears x ""Stawberry Shortcake,"" Samii Ryan
Finally, what can we expect from WildBrain for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026?
I can tell you that it’s an incredibly exciting time across all our business pillars: content creation, audience engagement and global licensing, with all these capabilities working together to deliver even more for fans across the globe. Our brands are internationally known and loved and we have the expertise to build on these deep roots and take advantage of our creativity to bring together exciting collaborations whether in content, digital or consumer products, or across all three. I’ve mentioned just some of our plans for this year but there is so much more to come. Watch this space!
Licensing Expo 2025 will be held May 20-22 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nev. Find WildBrain on booth J206. Check out the Licensing Expo Event Planner to book an appointment.

Pop Mart,"Economic Watch: From designer toys to AI creations, Chinese toymakers go global with innovation, originality - Xinhua",2025-04-15 05:00:45,"People linger around a POP MART store, a Chinese pop culture brand, near Louvre Museum in Paris, France, on March 18, 2025. (Xinhua/Zhang Baihui)
Editor's note: China has long been known as the ""factory of the world,"" with the Made-in-China label often associated with cheap and low-quality products. However, this perception is now becoming a thing of the past. Driven by rising R&D investment and consumption upgrades, many Chinese manufacturers are advancing up the value chain and gaining ground in the high-end market. Xinhua hereby presents a series of three stories that examine upgrades in the country's manufacturing sector. The following is the first piece in the series that explores how the toy industry is reinventing itself to go global.
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Paris' Louvre Museum has become the latest hot spot for toy collectors, with enthusiasts lining up for exclusive designer toys from Chinese pop culture brand POP MART, featuring its iconic characters like Labubu redesigned after Western art masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh's self-portrait and Manet's The Fifer.
POP MART opened a 60-square-meter store near the museum last summer as part of its overseas market expansion, drawing fans from across Europe. Victoire, a POP MART fan from France, has been collecting the brand's blind box figurines for a year and a half.
""I'm quite fascinated with the concepts the blind boxes contain. They are incredibly adorable and colorful. They bring joy to the inner child within me,"" the lady in her 20s told Xinhua.
For decades, China has been known as the ""factory of the world"" for low-cost products. POP MART's designer toys stand as a prime example of a new wave of innovative Chinese products, revolutionizing global perspectives on ""Made in China"" within the toy industry.
DESIGNER TOY ON A ROLL
With its original intellectual property (IP) and innovative designs, Beijing-based POP MART has quickly risen in the burgeoning blind box market, where primarily young consumers are spending heavily on collectible figurines shrouded in mystery.
The brand operates over 500 retail stores and nearly 2,500 Robo Shops worldwide. With the help of these stores and e-commerce platforms, its products have been sold in nearly 100 countries and regions.
POP MART's revenue more than doubled last year to 13 billion yuan (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars), and its adjusted net profit surged nearly 186 percent year on year to 3.4 billion yuan. Sales in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, together with overseas markets, soared 375 percent to nearly 5.1 billion yuan.
Nan Fang, a Chinese artist based in Paris for over a decade, has witnessed firsthand the rise and the success of Chinese designer toys in the overseas market. ""POP MART products are far more than merely toys. These items are, in essence, vibrant artworks imbued with life and spirit,"" she said.
Besides POP MART, WoFactory in China's southern city of Dongguan, China's toy manufacturing heartland, also witnessed success in the designer toy market.
It has so far received orders totaling over 100 million yuan for merchandise based on characters from ""Ne Zha 2,"" the blockbuster animated sequel that has sparked a nationwide craze for IP derivatives and a surge in demand for Ne Zha-themed merchandise.
Following a strong start to the year, WoFactory president Sun Wenke expressed confidence that robust sales growth will continue throughout the rest of 2025.
Dongguan is home to over 4,000 manufacturers and nearly 1,500 supporting enterprises in the designer toy industry, producing nearly 85 percent of China's designer toys and a quarter of the global animation-related merchandise.
Nationwide, China's designer toy industry is poised for robust expansion in the coming years. Industrial data showed that the market size of China's designer toys is expected to exceed 110 billion yuan in 2026, nearly doubling from around 60 billion yuan in 2023 and taking up around 20 percent of the global designer toy market.
Sun Wenkai, a research fellow at Renmin University of China, believes that an efficient industrial chain, huge domestic demand, decades of production experience, and the rise of Chinese designers who understand cultural diversity are the key drivers behind the rapid development of China's designer toy industry.
EMBARKING ON AI WAVE
As China's technological capabilities expand with the rollout of more AI models, many toy makers are increasingly leveraging AI as a powerful tool to enhance product interactivity and overall appeal.
One of the companies riding the wave of AI innovation is Shanghai-based startup FoloToy. Using Chinese AI chips and the popular chatbot DeepSeek, FoloToy has turned fluffy animal-shaped toys into interactive English tutors and daily companions for children, according to Wang Le, the company's founder and CEO.
FoloToy started developing AI-integrated toys in 2023 and has sold more than 20,000 units through e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and Amazon in 2024.
In the city of Yiwu, east China's Zhejiang Province, a major global trading hub for small commodities, toy retailers have also seen a surging demand for AI-powered toys.
""We've designed Arabic-speaking smart dolls for the Middle Eastern market, with about 70 percent of our recent orders coming from the region,"" said Sun Lijuan, owner and designer of a local toy store.
Yiwu's highly efficient industrial chain enables new products to move from concept to production in as little as a day, giving manufacturers a sharp competitive edge.
Thanks to mature industrial clusters, intellectual capital and the push for brand building, China has built a competitive edge in high-end manufacturing and brand operations, said An Zidong, professor of economics at Renmin University of China.
""Driven by structural changes in the labor force, consumption upgrades and technological progress, China's manufacturing industry is undergoing a profound transformation toward high-end, brand-oriented and intelligent development,"" An added. ■

Pop Mart International Group Limited's (HKG:9992) 29% Jump Shows Its Popularity With Investors
Pop Mart International Group Limited (HKG:9992) shares have continued their recent momentum with a 29% gain in the last month alone. This latest share price bounce rounds out a remarkable 413% gain over the last twelve months.
After such a large jump in price, given close to half the companies in Hong Kong have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 10x, you may consider Pop Mart International Group as a stock to avoid entirely with its 63.7x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.
With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Pop Mart International Group has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.
Check out our latest analysis for Pop Mart International Group
Keen to find out how analysts think Pop Mart International Group's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?
There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Pop Mart International Group's to be considered reasonable.
If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 191%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 280% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.
Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 42% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 14% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.
In light of this, it's understandable that Pop Mart International Group's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.
The Bottom Line On Pop Mart International Group's P/E
Pop Mart International Group's P/E is flying high just like its stock has during the last month. It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.
As we suspected, our examination of Pop Mart International Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.
Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Take a look at our free balance sheet analysis for Pop Mart International Group with six simple checks on some of these key factors.

According to the analysis of Everbright Securities, from the perspective of the reasons for the policy change, on the one hand, domestic consumers in the United States have limited ability to bear the price increase of electronic products, and the exemption of tariffs can alleviate their price increase pressure; On the other hand, the supply chain of some US tech giants is highly dependent on the global industrial chain, and the previous tariff policy has also hindered their own industrial development. In addition, the U.S. government's move is also seen as a certain adjustment in trade policy, trying to find a new balance in the complex and volatile international trade pattern. The implementation of this policy will have a positive impact. For the U.S. market, in the short term, it will help stabilize the price of electronic products, stimulate consumer demand, and then drive the market activity of related industries. From the perspective of the global industrial chain, this will alleviate the supply chain tension caused by the tariff policy to a certain extent, which is conducive to reducing costs, stabilizing production, and promoting the coordinated development of the industry.

Zhenyu Technology,Two Oxford researchers awarded Quantum Technology Fellowships - University of Oxford,2025-04-14 07:00:00,"Two Oxford researchers awarded Quantum Technology Fellowships
Today, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC (part of UK Research and Innovation, UKRI), has awarded eleven Quantum Technology Career Acceleration Fellowships to emerging UK research leaders, including two academics at the University of Oxford. These Fellowships, totalling £15 million, recognise the most promising early career researchers in the UK and will support them to develop their careers and push the boundaries of their field.
The Fellowships are designed to accelerate researchers’ careers and fast track them towards world-leading positions in the future, ensuring the UK maintains its position as a global force in quantum technology. The investment provides an invaluable opportunity to advance their research and innovation, and will provide opportunities to build connections with industry and end-users, reducing the gap between research and commercialisation.
Professor Charlotte Deane, EPSRC Executive Chair and a Professor in the University of Oxford’s Department of Statistics, said: ‘The Quantum Technologies sector is rapidly growing and evolving, so building a diverse and thriving workforce that can drive this forward is vital to unlocking economic and societal benefits in the future. By investing in the most promising researchers, not only are we boosting quantum skills, but we are also strengthening the research base and ensuring the UK can realise the incredible potential of new quantum technologies.’
Secretary of State for Science and Technology, Peter Kyle said: ‘Quantum – manipulating the universe at its smallest scale – has the potential to save millions for our economy, create thousands of jobs and improve businesses across the country – stopping fraudsters in their tracks, protecting our bank accounts and more. Backing our world-class quantum researchers and businesses is an important part of our Plan for Change.’
About the Oxford recipients:
Dr Jacob Blackmore, Department of Physics
Using the EPSRC investment, he aims to develop a quantum simulator based on molecular ions. This will be able to simulate complex phases of matter using the long-ranged interactions and rotational structure of the molecule. Building this device could demonstrate many techniques necessary to use molecular ions in trapped-ion quantum processors, which would enable vastly increased information density in the longer-term.
He said: ‘Since joining the ion trapping group here in Oxford, I have been fortunate enough to learn from an array of world-leading scientists. The EPSRC Quantum Technology Career Acceleration Fellowship is my opportunity to make a significant mark on the group and the quantum technology landscape by bringing my experience of molecular systems into Oxford's excellent quantum computing community. Further, this funding enables me to make real an idea that I have been thinking about for a number of years, a prospect which I am hugely excited about!’
Dr Zhenyu Cai, Department of Engineering Science
With the EPSRC investment, he aims to develop an integrated toolkit for suppressing errors in quantum machines through a full-stack approach, integrating error-suppression techniques across all layers of quantum computation. Key milestones towards achieving this include creating novel error-suppression frameworks, optimising for practical implementations, and experimental validation - all crucial for unlocking quantum computers' full potential for real-world applications.
He said: ‘I am honoured to receive the EPSRC Quantum Technologies Fellowship and truly excited about the opportunity to assemble a team of talented researchers to tackle errors in quantum machines—the critical bottleneck for practical quantum applications. The timing is ideal, as it opens up many opportunities to collaborate closely with the newly launched Oxford QCI3 Quantum Hub, the National Quantum Computing Centre nearby, and industrial partners.’

What is Webull?
Webull is a relatively new broker known for its free commissions and wide range of educational and support tools. Like other brokers on the market, Webull allows users to buy and sell shares of stocks, American depository receipts (ADRs), ETFs and options contracts. Webull has taken cues from competitors like Robinhood and Charles Schwab, combining powerful investing tools with commission-free trading.
Though Webull was only introduced in 2017, the broker has already made waves throughout the investing world. Some of the benefits that you’ll enjoy when you invest through Webull include:
- Commission-free investing: No account minimums, no commissions on stock buy and sell orders and even free options trading, it’s difficult to find a trading platform that offers more free options than Webull.
- Extended investing hours: Many brokers allow retail investors to trade only during the standard market hours of 9:30 a.m. EST to 4 p.m. EST. Webull offers investors full access to trading during the pre-market hours 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. EST and the after-hours trading session of 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. EST. This provides retail investors with more access to investing sessions that move the market outside of major trading hours.
- 24/7 customer service: If you’re a new investor, it can be helpful to know that you have a customer service team standing by to help you navigate trading issues. Webull’s customer service team is available 24/7 to assist with connectivity and investing issues.
While Webull offers a host of benefits that both new and seasoned investors love, this platform isn’t for everyone. Many Webull alternatives offer enhanced educational options alongside free trading.
Why Webull Might Not Be Right for You
With so many brokers offering trading capabilities online, you no longer need to settle for a broker that doesn’t offer you access to all of the features and securities you need. If any of the following features are important to you, Webull might not be the best platform for you.
- Access to long-term investment securities: Though Webull does an amazing job offering securities that active investors frequently trade, it doesn’t offer access to mutual funds or bonds. Despite the fact that the broker offers long-term investing accounts (like traditional and Roth IRAs), without access to these investments, you might have a limited selection of long-term opportunities.
- Limited access to additional securities: Though Webull makes it easy to invest in stocks, ETFs and options without paying an expensive commission, it doesn’t offer access to futures trading. It also offers limited support for cryptocurrencies — investors can only buy and sell major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum through Webull. If you’re looking for a more comprehensive source to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, Webull might not be the best option for you.
- A platform aimed towards beginners: Webull offers investors access to a wide range of analysis tools, including Level 2 investment data and an advanced charting platform, new investors might find these features overwhelming. Additionally, Webull offers only limited access to educational tools that you can use to learn about the market. If you’ve never traded or invested before, you may want to choose a platform that offers a more comprehensive learning and education center.
Invest with Confidence
No matter if you decide to invest in stocks through Webull or futures contracts through TradeStation, it’s important to take the time to compare platforms before you decide which trading platform you’d like to use. Be sure to compare news and education resources, commissions and pricing and market access before you open an account. This will help ensure that you don’t need to maintain multiple accounts to have access to all of the investments and tools you need.

Linklogis Inc.,Are Investors Undervaluing Linklogis Inc. (HKG:9959) By 36%? - simplywall.st,2025-04-14 05:08:53,"Are Investors Undervaluing Linklogis Inc. (HKG:9959) By 36%?
Key Insights
- The projected fair value for Linklogis is HK$1.67 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
- Current share price of HK$1.06 suggests Linklogis is potentially 36% undervalued
Does the April share price for Linklogis Inc. (HKG:9959) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
Our free stock report includes 1 warning sign investors should be aware of before investing in Linklogis. Read for free now.What's The Estimated Valuation?
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast
| 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032 | 2033 | 2034 | |
| Levered FCF (CN¥, Millions) | CN¥146.4m | CN¥163.5m | CN¥178.0m | CN¥190.5m | CN¥201.1m | CN¥210.5m | CN¥218.9m | CN¥226.6m | CN¥233.9m | CN¥240.8m |
| Growth Rate Estimate Source | Est @ 15.64% | Est @ 11.68% | Est @ 8.91% | Est @ 6.97% | Est @ 5.61% | Est @ 4.66% | Est @ 3.99% | Est @ 3.53% | Est @ 3.20% | Est @ 2.97% |
| Present Value (CN¥, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% | CN¥135 | CN¥139 | CN¥139 | CN¥138 | CN¥134 | CN¥129 | CN¥124 | CN¥118 | CN¥112 | CN¥107 |
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = CN¥1.3b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = CN¥241m× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.4%) = CN¥4.1b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= CN¥4.1b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= CN¥1.8b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is CN¥3.1b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of HK$1.1, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Important Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Linklogis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.145. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Moving On:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Linklogis, we've compiled three relevant items you should further examine:
- Risks: You should be aware of the 1 warning sign for Linklogis we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.

Unsupervised cows roaming through Amanzimtoti suburbs and the CBD are raising safety concerns and violating by-laws.
WHILE cows are lovable animals — especially when spotted peacefully grazing in the pastures — their unexpected presence in suburban areas and even the Amanzimtoti CBD poses risks not only to the animals themselves but also contravenes municipal by-laws.
Also read: Cows, newborn calf dead after N2 crash
Doonside resident Yvonne de Kock said she frequently sees cows grazing near her home, often navigating traffic without a herdsman in sight. She recently spotted a lone cow, possibly lost, grazing along Umfuleni Road near a construction site.
“This surely cannot be permitted in the light of by-laws. There are roadworks and this animal then walked around the corner to graze on the pavement. Trucks and heavy machinery are constantly moving in and out, making it a busy intersection. What if an accident is caused or the animal is injured? I have been in Toti for three years and was told this has been a long-standing situation,” said De Kock.
While eThekwini Municipality does not have an animal pound, Ward 97 councillor André Beetge said the city is budgeting R4.41m towards the SPCA under “Animal Pound Contractual Obligations”.
“The situation with cattle roaming the streets and grazing open space, was an inherited issue when we took office in 2011. Since then there has been a massive population explosion, and the same demands being experienced in water usage, sanitation, electricity capacity and traffic increases, have likewise resulted in these herds being more visible within the traditional urban areas that are less densely populated and more specific, where safer grazing is available,” said Beetge.
Also read: UPDATE: Police reveal disturbing details about body found at Mooi Hawens
He added that third parties are reluctant to get involved with these exercises as they require specialised vehicles and equipment, safe and secure holding areas, and compliance with the Pound Act in terms of feeding, inoculation, and other demands once such an animal is contained in custody.
“This is not a challenge unique to the larger Amanzimtoti area that directly borders Ingonyama Trust land on the inland side, as much the same occurs in the outer west and far northern parts of the city. That said and irrespective, there is also the matter of herdsmen, as these animals do indeed find themselves wandering the streets unmanaged to the point of even creating dangerous situations along the N2 freeway,” he said.
He concluded by saying the ward committee has noted the matter and a platform of debate has been initiated with traditional leadership in finding mutual ground and means of managing the situation.

MooMoo,4 Best M1 Finance Alternatives in April 2025 - Benzinga,2025-04-10 07:00:00,"An increasingly popular brokerage service, M1 Finance falls under a category known as robo-advisors. Essentially, robo-advisors use algorithms to help guide your platform to profitability. This facilitates the core advantage of hands-free investing, allowing you to live your life while advanced computer technology does the busy work of portfolio management.
On the surface, M1 Finance appears the most appropriate for beginner investors. Indeed, many new to Wall Street elect M1 for its fuss-free approach. However, even advanced traders could choose to allocate funds in an M1 account. Because an algorithm pulls the weight, you eliminate emotions and personal biases from your decisions. Interested in a different robo-advisor? Take a look at our list of M1 Finance alternatives.
Quick Look at the Top Alternatives to MF Finance:
- Best for No Commissions: Moomoo
- Best for Accessibility: E*TRADE
- Best for Satisfaction: Robinhood
- Best for Cryptocurrencies: Webull
4 Best Alternatives to M1 Finance
For those who are seeking a hands-free approach to their investment strategies, you will find it difficult to top M1 Finance. With its unique take of pie investing, you are able to remove the intimidation factor from the capital markets. As well, you have the confidence of investing alongside 80 Wall Street expert portfolios.
The drawback, however, is that M1 Finance doesn’t provide as comprehensive of a platform as its rival brokerages. Also, you may prefer greater control over your money, along with trading tactics. If you’re looking for something more hands-on, here are some alternatives to consider.
1. Best for No Commissions: Moomoo
Moomoo is an intuitive investment and trading platform with easy-to-use and professional tools, data and insights that equal a pro-level trading experience for all traders, no matter their level of expertise.
When you open a brokerage account with Moomoo Financial Inc, features will include:
- Real-time Level 2 stock and options market data for funded accounts
- Advanced technical indicators
- Unique charting tools
- Advanced options orders
- Full extended trading hours from 4 AM to 8 PM EST
- Multi-market quoting
- Low fees, $0 commission on U.S. Stocks and ETFs plus $0 equity options contract fees
- 4.1% APY in the Cash sweep program and a 4% boost for qualified customers
Users can reach out to the moomoo customer support team by phone during trading hours or via email. FAQs in the Help Center can also answer specific questions.
The site and app also helps users learn with a nice educational offering and a community with more than 20 million users worldwide.
Why We Picked It: Moomoo users can trade not only U.S. stocks but also international stocks from markets like Hong Kong and China.
2. Best for Accessibility: E*TRADE
One of the most popular trading platforms with a long history, investors continue to use E*TRADE for its comprehensive services. Its interface is intuitive enough to guide newcomers while offering advanced traders a plethora of tools that facilitate knowledge-based and data-driven transactions. Further, E*TRADE provides access to market analysis and educational materials, making it a comprehensive choice.
What really stands out for E*TRADE, though, is its excellent customer service. Help is only a phone call, email or live chat away. Better yet, it’s available 24/7. You can also go to one of the company’s 30 branches, with financial consultants ready to answer your burning questions.
Why We Picked It: E*TRADE provides more advanced trading tools and platforms. For instance, their Power E*TRADE platform includes features like advanced charting, technical analysis tools and customizable trading strategies.
3. Best for Satisfaction: Robinhood
Before the pandemic, many financial experts worried that millennials were not investing their wealth to the same degree as prior generations at the same age level. However, the present crisis changed all that as millions of workers found themselves operating from home. Naturally, this facilitated extra free time — time they spent on Robinhood trading stocks.
Perhaps the most pivotal reason that Robinhood appeals to younger generations is its relevance. Rather than deploying stuffy concepts and language, this platform features a “gamified” interface, bringing the fun factor that is all but nonexistent in many other brokerages. While gamified trading apps do have their critics, they also introduced valuable investment concepts to a generation that really wasn’t listening until now.
Why We Picked It: Just like M1 Finance, Robinhood offers commission-free trades on stocks and ETFs. This means you don’t have to pay fees when buying or selling popular stocks, which can help you save money on investments.
4. Best for Cryptocurrencies: Webull
Similar to other recent investing platforms, Webull caters to the young crowd — specifically, to the mobile-1st generation who grew up knowing nothing but digitalization technologies. However, Webull is also fundamentally grounded, offering benefits associated with traditional brokerages such as 24/7 phone and email customer support.
But the standout attribute — especially if you’re interested in alternative investments — is Webull’s access to cryptocurrencies. Again, this is one of those controversial sectors because of the underlying volatility. However, cryptocurrencies (unlike stocks) features round-the-clock trading. This really connects with younger folks, who may not operate by the standard 9-to-5 lifestyle that older generations have grown accustomed to.
Why We Picked It: Webull has a paper trading feature that lets you practice trading with virtual money. This is useful for beginners who want to learn without risking real money.
What is M1 Finance?
Aside from its robo-advisor algorithms, what makes M1 Finance appealing to a broad audience is its “pie investing.” Pies are a mixture of different stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that cover various sectors. You can craft your own pie or select from “Expert Pies” — portfolio allocations that investment gurus have developed.
While M1 Finance certainly has a reputation as a beginner’s investment portfolio, the platform really appeals to those who prefer delegating the process of money management to another entity. Also, some folks just don’t care for the mechanics of investing and would rather spend their time on pursuits meaningful to them.
Why M1 Finance Might Not be Right for You
Obviously, not everyone has the same attitude about money management. For those who prefer to know the ins and outs of their portfolios, M1 Finance may not be the most appropriate platform.
In addition, a drawback for M1 is that it doesn’t offer the greatest library of investment selections. For instance, if you want to trade options, forex or cryptocurrencies, you’re out of luck. Naturally, rookie investors who progress in their investing endeavors will want to explore the speculative side of this business. They may find M1’s platform restricting.
Finally, an oddity with M1 is that it lacks advanced transactional tools such as limit orders. Instead, this platform exclusively uses market orders or conducting buy/sell orders at the current market price instead of a specific one. Certainly, this will turn off advanced traders.
M1 Fits With Your Trading Tools
Robo-advisors have their place and indeed may expand their footprint. Thanks to platforms like M1 Finance, investors can grow their money automatically while attending to their personal and professional endeavors. While everyone should invest, not all have the temerity to watch over their portfolio like a hawk.
Then again, many do. Therefore, M1 Finance — as brilliant as the platform is — does not represent a one-size-fits-all solution. Investors who want greater control with their trades or who know exactly which sectors they want to invest in should consider viable alternatives that fit their needs.
Frequently Asked Questions
Is Acorns like M1 finance?
Acorns offers five different portfolios based off your risk tolerance while M1 finance offers mostly ETFs and stocks.
Can you retire using M1 Finance?
You can invest for the future with M1 Finance, but the platform does not offer retirement-specific accounts.
Is M1 Finance designed for advisory accounts?
Advisory accounts can be opened on M1 Finance, but remember that you should reach out to the platform for help if you need to combine several accounts in one place.

Pop Mart,"POP MART Reflects on Monty’s Collab, Los Angeles Store Opening - License Global",2025-04-10 07:00:00,"POP MART Reflects on Monty’s Collab, Los Angeles Store OpeningPOP MART Reflects on Monty’s Collab, Los Angeles Store Opening
Emily Brough, licensing head, POP MART, chats with License Global about some of the company’s latest moves.
POP MART, the global designer toy and entertainment brand, has announced two moves in the company: the grand opening of a new store in Westfield Culver City and a celebration through a food collaboration with the city’s Monty’s Good Burger.
This marks POP MART’s eighth store in the SoCal region, along with a new store in the Northridge Fashion Center on the horizon. The Westfield Culver City store officially opened its doors on March 21 and held a grand opening ceremony on March 29. This POP MART’s 25th brick-and-mortar location. From April 4-6, all four Monty’s locations across Los Angeles featured limited-edition menu items and custom packaging inspired by POP MART’s IP, Peach Riot. Included on the menu was the Peach Riot Shake, a peach pie shakes with orange swirl, and the Peach Riot meal, with a classic burger and fries with special limited edition dipping sauce. Meal boxes, burger wraps, stickers, placemats and more were themed after Peach Riot. This marks Peach Riot’s first restaurant takeover and a moment for fans to step inside their universe – celebrating the hustle, the music and the creativity that fuels the band.
License Global spoke with Emily Brough, licensing head, POP MART, about POP MART’s Monty’s collaboration and store opening.
License Global: How did the Monty’s partnership come about?
Emily Brough: The collaboration came together through shared creative alignment – Monty’s and POP MART both celebrate bold storytelling, individuality and community, so bringing them together for Peach Riot felt like an organic next step. The concept of blending music, fandom and food offered a unique opportunity to extend Peach Riot’s Rush Hour storyline in a playful, real-world way. The team saw a fun connection in having Gigi pick up a gig at Monty’s, and the rest of the story unfolded from there. It’s a fresh take on brand storytelling that reflects the hustle behind every big dream – especially in LA.
What makes Monty’s and Peach Riot a good fit for a collaboration?
Monty’s felt like a natural fit to support the launch of Peach Riot’s Rush Hour blind box series – it captures the energy, hustle and creativity of LA, much like Libby Frame, the artist behind Peach Riot, and her own journey in the city.
As part of their Rush Hour Tour, the girls of Peach Riot are picking up part-time jobs to fund their music dreams – Gigi just landed a gig at Monty’s. Between flipping patties and pouring shakes, Poppy and Frankie stop by during her shifts to write new songs and keep the music going. This collaboration is a playful reflection of the band’s real-life grind: chasing big dreams while working hard to make them happen.
What does this collaborative meal include?
The Peach Riot x Monty’s meal includes two exclusive menu items: the Peach Riot Shake – a peach pie shake with an orange swirl – and the Peach Riot Meal, which features Monty’s classic burger and fries paired with a limited-edition habanero peach dipping sauce. Each order is served in full Peach Riot style, with custom-branded packaging including collectible meal boxes, burger wraps, placemats, stickers and more – bringing fans directly into the world of the band.
Switching gears – POP MART recently launched a store in Los Angeles. Tell me a bit about the launch and your overall retail plans.
Last month, we opened a new store at Westfield Culver City, our 27th brick-and-mortar location in the U.S. and our eighth in California. The fan response has been incredible, especially in L.A., where the energy and creativity of the city aligns so closely with our brand. We’re also gearing up to open our next California location at Northridge Fashion Center.
Since launching in the U.S. in mid-2022, we’ve expanded rapidly. In 2024 alone, we opened more than 20 stores in major cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. And we’re just getting started. In 2025, we’re focused on deepening our footprint in key cultural hubs while expanding into new regions. We plan to open stores on both coasts and in top-tier retail destinations to bring POP MART to even more collectors nationwide.
In addition to retail, we’re focused on expanding our artist collaborations – introducing fresh talent and growing our plush collections, which continue to resonate with collectors. Fans can also expect exciting new product releases, exclusive drops, and licensing partnerships that build on the momentum we’ve seen in 2024. This year is all about scaling thoughtfully and welcoming even more fans into the POP MART universe.

Chinasoft International,Trump’s Trade War Is Strengthening China’s Soft Power - WIRED,2025-04-10 07:00:00,"President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports have sent millions of manufacturers, retailers, and small businesses on both sides of the Pacific scrambling to cope with a sudden and punishing rise in costs. After Beijing responded with its own retaliatory measures, the White House said that a wide range of Chinese-made goods—from toys to electronics—will now face an effective tariff rate of 145 percent, a steep jump from the 34 percent figure Trump initially outlined just last week.
But despite looming economic pain, China is not backing down or making concessions to Trump. If anything, the government appears more defiant than ever, especially after some political narratives about the country’s manufacturing strength have started to shift in recent years. In the long run, in fact, an escalating battle with the US could wind up being an opportunity for China to leverage its growing soft power. “If the US is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China’s response will continue to the end,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, said in a statement to WIRED.
The US previously justified its punitive trade measures against China by citing the country’s troubling human rights record and accusing it of repeatedly stealing American intellectual property. But China has now developed its own global tech brands, is home to a leading artificial intelligence startup, and has opened more branches of domestic drink shop Mixue than there are Starbucks or McDonald's locations worldwide. The Trump administration’s alleged human rights abuses, meanwhile, are alarming civil liberties groups and observers around the world.
“This is kind of an interesting confluence of events where you have this soft power win over on the China side combined with effectively a complete abdication of soft power altogether from the United States,” says Kevin Xu, founder of the technology hedge fund Interconnected Capital and a former White House staffer under President Obama.
Many Chinese citizens seem pleased that their leaders are standing up to the US, though public polling in the country can be sparse and unreliable. As Trump’s tariffs went into effect, the Chinese government appeared to censor hashtags that mentioned the specifics of the measures, like “104 tariff rate,” but it allowed others focused on making fun of the United States to continue circulating. “America is fighting a trade war while begging for eggs,” read one particularly popular hashtag coined by China’s state broadcaster.
“We support our country in standing firm to the end! We’re not afraid of temporary hardship—what we fear is eternal cowardice,"" says the owner of an artificial Christmas tree factory in China who asked to remain anonymous due to the risks of speaking to foreign media outlets. The owner tells WIRED that the tariffs are already having negative impacts on her industry, and she expects the competition for non-US markets like South America and Russia to be stiff next year, but “no matter what, we'll get through it.”
Trump administration officials have promoted the tariffs as a way to boost US manufacturing and create more high-paying jobs. But American small business owners painted a very different picture of the situation on TikTok. In one video, the founder of a trendy hair accessories brand rolled her eyes and explained that the company’s products “literally cannot be made here.” In another, the CEO of a shoe company similarly said China “is just the only place I could manufacture.” The owner of a company that makes self-checkout kiosks lamented about how awful his experiences have been working with suppliers in the US compared to those in China. “What it’s about is Americans are a bunch of babies and they are hard to work with,” he told the camera.
The founder of a London-based clothing brand struck a more heartwarming tone, uploading a slideshow of pictures of herself posing with the garment workers her company partners with in China, set to The Fray song “Look After You.” The text overlaid on one photo read “Our wins are their wins.” The TikTok post received over 55,000 likes, an indication of how attitudes toward China have evolved among at least some Western consumers, compared to the past, when the country’s factories were mostly associated with pumping out cheap, flimsy goods. “Suddenly people see, oh, it’s not this imagined ‘slave labor’ that's making my clothes, they're actually humans,” says Tianyu Fang, a fellow at the New America think tank and one of the cofounders of the Chinese internet culture newsletter Chaoyang Trap.
In recent weeks, as the Trump administration’s ever-changing trade policies enraged close American allies like Canada, a number of prominent commentators have even begun suggesting that perhaps the era of American exceptionalism was over. The coming decades, they argued, would now be defined by the rise of China.
“The Chinese century, brought to you by Donald Trump,” David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic and former speechwriter for George W. Bush said in a social media post on April 2. New York Times opinion writer Thomas Friedman published a column the same day raving about a recent trip to China during which he witnessed the country’s impressive infrastructure and technological development. It was headlined “I Just Saw the Future. It Was Not in America.”
“When people say this is the Chinese century, what they really mean is that the consensus that this will be the American century is being broken,” says Fang.
Growing Influence
When Trump’s most comprehensive tariffs caused global stock markets to take a nosedive earlier this week, US social media influencer Darren Watkins Jr., better known as IShowSpeed to his over 100 million collective followers, was wrapping up a sprawling tour across China with stops in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and other cities. Watkins spent days livestreaming himself mingling with Chinese celebrities and taking a boat ride with Hong Kong’s glittering skyline as the backdrop. By broadcasting in real time, IShowSpeed’s fans got an “unprecedented opportunity” to see “an unfiltered China,” Yaling Jiang, CEO of the strategy firm ApertureChina, wrote in her newsletter.
Many Americans got another direct glimpse inside China earlier this year when the US was set to ban TikTok nationwide. Anticipating the app might soon disappear, hundreds of thousands of people flocked to RedNote, another Chinese-owned social media app, where they saw posts of people in China showing off their domestic-made electric cars and comfortable urban apartments. TikTok itself, which was created by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, is a testament to China’s growing soft power. Trump has vowed to save the app, and despite warnings from US lawmakers about the data security risks it poses, fewer Americans support banning it than did a few years ago.
But positive depictions of China won’t shield it from the economic damage ahead. Trump’s tariffs are so high that they will likely bring trade between the world’s two largest economies to a screeching halt. The signs of that disruption are already visible: Bloomberg reported that Amazon has canceled a number of wholesale product orders, like $500,000 worth of Chinese-made beach chairs for the upcoming US summer season, while a toy maker in China’s Guangdong province told The Wall Street Journal that a longtime client in Maryland similarly canceled a shipment scheduled to be delivered in June.
In as little as a few weeks, Americans may have a harder time finding some products on store shelves, which will eventually lead to higher consumer prices. The Chinese workers who make those items, meanwhile, could soon find themselves out of work. “The US is facing shortages and inflation, and on the Chinese side, they’re facing job losses and deflation,” says Gerard DiPippo, acting associate director of the RAND China Research Center and an expert on China’s economy. DiPippo adds that he’s stocking up on cooking ingredients from China in case they become unavailable, like szechuan peppercorns.
While there are some ways the Chinese government could try to stimulate spending and prop up local businesses, its options are fairly limited. Over the past few years, a domestic housing market crash has eroded the savings of China’s middle class and youth unemployment has soared, causing demand for things like shopping and eating at restaurants to fall. In response, China focused even more on increasing exports, making the country especially vulnerable to Trump’s attacks. China sent about $400 billion worth of goods to the US last year, and there are few other places it could shift that trade instead.
It’s unclear how things will unfold. China’s economic challenges could limit its ability to extend influence globally, and many will continue to view its authoritarian regime with skepticism. In the future, the cultural void left by the US may remain vacant as the world becomes increasingly fragmented. “I personally see the vacuum scenario more possible, where we’re all kind of fending for ourselves,” says Xu.

Pop Mart,Strategic Positioning and Resilience: Wei Dustin’s Buy Rating on Pop Mart International Group Limited - TipRanks,2025-04-10 07:00:00,"Pop Mart International Group Limited (735 – Research Report), the Consumer Cyclical sector company, was revisited by a Wall Street analyst today. Analyst Wei Dustin from Morgan Stanley maintained a Buy rating on the stock and has a HK$164.00 price target.
Wei Dustin has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Pop Mart International Group Limited’s strategic positioning and resilience in the face of external challenges. The company is actively diversifying its supply chain by increasing its reliance on suppliers in Vietnam, which is expected to cover a significant portion of US sales by 2025. This strategic move is aimed at mitigating the impact of high tariffs on Chinese imports, thereby safeguarding its margins.
Furthermore, Pop Mart’s ability to raise average selling prices in the US demonstrates its pricing power and adaptability to tariff fluctuations. The company’s strong performance in China, coupled with its global direct-to-consumer model, positions it well for sustained growth.

Pop Mart,"Is Miniso’s Top Toy trying to be Pop Mart, or something else? - KrASIA",2025-04-10 07:00:00,"In March, all eyes were on designer toys.
Pop Mart released its latest financial report, showing annual revenue breaking the RMB 10 billion (USD 1.4 billion) mark for the first time. Profits rose more than 180%, and its market capitalization hit a record high of over HKD 200 billion (USD 25.7 billion).
Meanwhile, Top Toy, a designer toy brand under Miniso, opened its first flagship store in a prime location on Shanghai’s Nanjing Road. At the same time, it announced a major global expansion strategy: to open more than 1,000 stores across the world’s top 100 commercial districts within the next five years.
“Cultural consumption and global cultural expansion are the direction for both Miniso and Top Toy,” said Ye Guofu, founder of Miniso.
Top Toy entered the market just a day after Pop Mart went public, and while it was a latecomer, momentum has been building. Last year, the company reported revenue of RMB 980 million (USD 137.2 million), a 45% increase year-on-year. It also turned a profit. The number of stores nearly doubled—from 148 to 276.
As for its international footprint, Top Toy has already opened five stores in Southeast Asia, in markets like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Looking ahead, the company plans for overseas sales to account for more than half of its total business.
Naturally, comparisons surface as both companies vie for position in the same space. But when asked how Top Toy stacks up against Pop Mart, founder Sun Yuanwen told 36Kr he doesn’t view Pop Mart as a direct competitor. The two are diverging in approach: Pop Mart builds around its own original IP, while Top Toy focuses on derivative works licensed from major IPs.
Top Toy did initially attempt to follow Pop Mart’s path by developing original characters. But, as Sun put it, “We lost money in a way that was just ugly.” That chapter, he said, is closed.
“The golden window for original IPs has already passed, and it needs to find a new way forward,” Sun said. “At the time, we saw an opportunity in the blind box segment for major IPs—huge market potential, but no dominant players. So we made a decisive move into this space, focusing on derivative works of top-tier IPs.”
The following transcript has been edited and consolidated for brevity and clarity.
36Kr: You launched your first store just as Pop Mart went public. Its path had already been validated. Didn’t you consider copying that model?
Sun Yuanwen (SY): We did. In our first year, we developed our own original IPs—and it was a disaster financially. We lacked the capacity and the resolve to really pull off original IP development.
Over the past two to three years, we’ve opened many stores and tested a variety of IPs. Eventually, we realized we had to find a path that worked for us. That’s when we discovered derivative works based on major IPs—it actually worked.
So I’m not saying Pop Mart’s model is bad. It’s just that we wanted to play to our strengths and stick to our own ideas, rather than blindly following someone else’s path.
36Kr: Was the financial loss due to poor sales or high development costs?
SY: Both. Development costs were sky-high, and we didn’t have the capacity to meticulously craft the products or assemble a professional team to incubate and operate the IPs. Sales were indeed poor, too.
By that point, the market had already matured. Consumers were obsessing over a few established original IPs. So launching a new IP meant burning a ton of cash on marketing, with a long and uncertain return timeline.
Meanwhile, there was still a massive, relatively untapped market for blind boxes based on major IPs, and no leading players in that space. Given our strengths and efficiency, we decided to enter that lane and become a leader in derivative works based on top-tier IPs.
36Kr: Your focus is on derivative works of major IPs—like Disney and Sanrio. Aren’t licensing fees really high?
SY: Licensing terms from big IP holders are public and transparent—they don’t tailor terms to each licensee. What matters to them is whether you have the strength to execute. IP owners look for two things: your product development and operational capabilities, and your ability to move product—whether your creations can spread within and across communities.
Even if you offer more money, a company like Disney might still reject you if it doubts your ability to run with the IP. We’ve proven over the past few years that we’re capable of handling these properties.
36Kr: Are your derivative works of major IPs selling well because of your unique development and operations, or because the IPs themselves already have strong brand equity?
SY: We believe the uniqueness of the IP itself isn’t that important—it’s the uniqueness of the design that matters. So when we license big IPs, we don’t just use their existing image banks. We redesign everything from scratch.
We also really understand our consumers. We reimagine IPs in ways that resonate with them—that’s our entire logic.
36Kr: If the uniqueness of an IP isn’t important, why is everyone fighting to sign major IPs?
SY: Because major IPs come with built-in audiences, applications, and a degree of certainty that original IPs just don’t offer. That’s a completely different logic from uniqueness.
And precisely because uniqueness isn’t the main factor, many players can work with the same IP. We don’t have exclusive rights to a big IP, but during the development process, we rely on our own design, supply chain, and distribution channels to execute better than anyone else.
It’s like being on a grassland—you don’t need to be the lion. Be the fastest antelope. Even if others are working with the same IP, we aim to do it best. That’s more aligned with where we are in our growth phase.
Original IP development, on the other hand, is a totally different route—Pop Mart has stuck with that story all along.
36Kr: So have you succeeded in doing it best?
SY: Over the past two to three years, our strong sales have validated this approach. It’s what turned us from lossmaking to profitable.
36Kr: Have you developed a playbook?
SY: We’ve built out a robust database and consumer profiling system, and we have a steady stream of returning customers. That gives us a big edge over individual studios or brands.
36Kr: But Pop Mart has those too.
SY: Sure, and in many ways, it’s executing really well across the board. Like I said before, it is focused on original IP. If we just followed Pop Mart’s lead, we wouldn’t be differentiated enough.
36Kr: What does it take to make an original IP go viral?
SY: There’s no formula—it’s almost metaphysical. You need a deep bench of original designs, the ability to incubate and operate the IP, and you have to test it in the market. All of that requires huge investment, with way too many unknowns. We’d rather chase something more certain.
36Kr: Is there also uncertainty in whether derivative works of big IPs will succeed?
SY: Much less. Take Disney and Sanrio—they have been operating for decades. So when a new product format enters the market, there’s an opportunity window. It’s just a matter of who moves first. Not many people were doing new product formats for mature IPs, so we jumped in early and reaped the first wave of returns.
36Kr: Back when you were trying to build original IPs, was Ye Guofu involved in the decision-making?
SY: He was involved every step of the way. All decisions were made jointly. At the time, we were just entering the designer toy space—it was all trial and error.
36Kr: Was Pop Mart’s IPO a factor in your decision to enter the market?
SY: We’d been preparing to open our first store for six months to a year. Back then, blind boxes and figurines were still niche. I made the pitch saying that, as a kid from the 1990s, I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like figurines. But the market was relatively blank, so we wanted to launch a store. We were already working on blind boxes too. When Pop Mart went public, the market exploded overnight. That wasn’t something we anticipated.
36Kr: With no clear benchmark, how did you convince Ye Guofu?
SY: I made a proper business plan. I mean, if you’re going to pitch for money, you’ve got to show something [laughs].
36Kr: Did he have doubts?
SY: His biggest question was whether this would become a significant industry or remain a niche business. At the time, it looked like a small opportunity. In my pitch deck, I didn’t even mention Pop Mart—I used Bandai’s toy stores in Japan as a reference instead.
When I made the pitch, Pop Mart wasn’t yet public and only had fewer than 100 stores. Meanwhile, Miniso had 3,000 stores in China alone. To Ye, Pop Mart seemed small. But after it went public, suddenly everyone thought blind boxes were the next big thing. So honestly, both the industry and we ourselves owe Pop Mart a thank you.
36Kr: Did Pop Mart’s performance after the IPO influence or motivate you?
SY: It proved that blind boxes were going to become a major category. So we doubled down—allocating more shelf space and increasing sales focus.
We were actually the first company to realize blind boxes would become a dominant product type. When we opened our first store the day after Pop Mart listed, blind boxes weren’t our main focus—we also had figurines, statues, and other categories. But soon after, we realized blind boxes could be the core product of the designer toy world.
36Kr: Back in 2021, you said 70% of the product mix was developed in-house and 30% was sourced externally. What’s the ratio now?
SY: It’s 50-50 now. But we’re aiming for a 70-30 split again. That 30% provides variety—we want to keep exploring new IPs and product categories by partnering with other outstanding brands. We don’t want to lock ourselves in a bubble. Otherwise, the industry won’t scale.
36Kr: Why reduce the share of externally sourced products?
SY: Because we need strong financial metrics. We’ll still empower valuable original IPs, domestic IPs, and innovative studios—we want to serve consumer demand. But pure reselling leads to homogenization and competition on sameness. From a brand standpoint, if you can’t attract consumers into your stores, you’re done.
36Kr: So is profitability the top goal?
SY: Not exactly. Our top goal is global brand recognition—to open 100 stores in the world’s top 100 malls.
We’re still investing heavily, and we don’t really care whether profits are at 10% or 15%. But we do need to be profitable—we’re part of a publicly listed company and have to be accountable to shareholders. So while profit isn’t the main goal, a company that never turns a profit just isn’t viable.
36Kr: Is that something Ye Guofu has demanded?
SY: No. That’s just my own understanding of how a business should work. If you’re not making money, you can’t reinvest. How do you open 100 stores if you’re always bleeding cash? The group has supported us for four or five years—we can’t keep relying on that. It’s undignified. Now we’ve got our own cash flow and we’re profitable.
36Kr: Store openings are expensive. How do you know your model is sustainable?
SY: We’re big enough now to cover those costs. Of course, there was a painful transition from small to large scale. In year one, yes, costs were high because we didn’t have enough stores. But we’ve turned that corner. We’re near 300 stores now, and last year’s revenue hit nearly RMB 1 billion. Going forward, our marginal costs will shrink. That’s a good sign.
36Kr: You once said your strengths and weaknesses are both very clear?
SY: Our strengths are in store operations and supply chain. In those areas, we’re neck and neck with Pop Mart—or even better when it comes to international expansion, because our group already has years of overseas experience.
Our weaknesses are the lack of a first-mover advantage and strong original IPs. Pop Mart is the market leader, and its brand assets are stronger than ours.
But look—they have been at this for 15 years. We’ve only been around for four. That’s fair. Over the next five to ten years, we’ll continue closing the gap.
36Kr: Who do you consider your main competitor now?
SY: Honestly, we don’t see anyone as our direct competitor.
36Kr: But you kept mentioning Pop Mart in your product launch presentation.
SY: People care about it, so I have to address it. But Pop Mart isn’t really our rival. I actually love having stores next to theirs. It helps grow the entire market. I’d love to see a third or fourth big player enter the space—that’s the only way to prove this market is really big.
Pop Mart is like the iOS closed-loop system—it controls everything in-house. We’re more like Android—we’re building a platform that accommodates third-party products and IPs.
36Kr: When your plushies or blind boxes are on shelves next to Pop Mart’s, why would consumers choose yours?
SY: That’s not quite how it works. This is fan-driven. If you’re a Wang Yibo fan, you’re not buying a Xiao Zhan concert ticket. Our buyers are fans of specific IPs—if they love Disney or Sanrio, they’ll buy our stuff. If they love Labubu plushies, they will buy Pop Mart’s.
People follow the IPs they love. If the product is good, they’ll buy it. If not, they will complain.
36Kr: But fan culture still has different tiers—like Wang Yibo versus Jay Chou.
SY: Same with IPs. Some stay hot for decades—like Jay Chou for 20 years, or Wang Yibo for seven to eight years. But the nature of their fame differs. Some IPs succeed through content, others through design. You have to find the most fitting way to convey each IP’s vibe.
36Kr: How do you identify the right “vibe” during IP development?
SY: We’re in constant contact with consumers. We gather a lot of user feedback and data to identify common emotional denominators.
36Kr: What’s the most important thing for Top Toy in the next one to three years? And what are you most curious about regarding competitors?
SY: The most important thing is store openings and product development. Keep signing IPs, designing products, engaging with users, and exploring new formats. You’ve got to plant seeds to grow trees. You can’t expect a tree to sprout if you don’t even plant a seed. That seed might die, or it might grow into a sapling—or it could thrive. But first, you’ve got to plant.
As for competitors—I’m most curious about what product category they will bet on next.
36Kr: Is there a common fear across the industry?
SY: That consumers might lose interest in designer toys. What if people get tired of the category? Look at sportswear—it’s booming now because more people are exercising. But what if people stop working out someday? The same fear exists for us—what if consumers lose interest in designer toys? That’s something we all have to face.

How to pick the best online brokerage and trading platform in Singapore?
There are a few key considerations when picking an investment platform that suits you needs. We would be looking at the following:
- Licensed and trusted. We would like our money to be safe with the investment platform. One of the ways to have a greater peace of mind is to ensure that the brokerage is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). All the brokerages we compare in this review are regulated by the MAS.
- Low fees. Trading commission fees may erode your long term investment returns, which is why we will be comparing the commission fees and platform fees you will incur across different brokerages.
- Product and market access: It is also important to select a broker that offers you access to the products and markets you are looking to invest in. For example, some brokers may not offer you the ability to invest in the Singapore market or trade options, so you will need to find one that meets your investment style.
#1 - Lowest cost online brokerage for trading Singapore stocks
When you are picking a brokerage account in Singapore, you will find that there are two different account types: CDP-linked accounts and custodian accounts.
With a CDP-linked account, the stocks are purchased in your name and held in your CDP account. With a CDP-linked account, you become the owner of the shares listed on the Singapore Exchange and a company shareholder.
With a custodian account, your ownership in the stock will be through the broker, which will hold the shares in CDP on your behalf. However, you will remain the ultimate beneficial owner of the stock.
Custodian accounts typically offer lower fees compared to CDP accounts.
Custodian accounts
For trading in Singapore stocks, Webull Singapore, Moomoo SG, Tiger Brokers, and Syfe Trade offer competitive rates with a total commission fee and platform fee of 0.06% and below, and minimum fee per trade of below S$2.
It's worth noting that Moomoo Singapore is currently offering 1-year zero commission for Singapore stocks for new users, bringing the minimum fee down to S$0.99 or 0.03% per transaction.
CMC Invest offers a competitive commission of 0.04%, with a minimum fee of S$2. Users also get 5 free trades per month. ProsperUs is also offering a promotional fee of 0.06%, with no minimum fee.
This is followed closely by POEMS, Interactive Brokers and SAXO Classic, which charge a commission of 0.08% per trade.
For trading in Singapore ETFs, FSMOne offers a flat fee of S$3.80 per trade, which makes it cost-effective for investors buying a significant amount of ETFs in one trade.

#3 - Lowest cost trading platform and online brokerage for CPF investments
According to CPF, there are only nine platforms that allow you to invest using CPF and SRS funds. These would include DBS Vickers, OCBC Securities, UOB Kay-Hian, FSMOne, CIMB Securities, Phillip Securities (POEMS), Maybank Kim Eng, Lim & Tan, and KGI Securities (Singapore).
Unfortunately, you will not be able to invest your CPF or SRS funds with popular online brokers like Tiger Brokers, Moomoo SG, and Webull.
Amongst these brokers, the POEMS Cash Plus Account offers a flat fee of 0.08% per trade, with no minimum commission for trading SGX-listed stocks and ETFs.
FSMOne also has comparatively lower commission fees with a fixed rate of S$8.80 per transaction.
This would mean that it would be cheaper to use POEMS Cash Plus if your transaction value falls below S$11,000, and cheaper to use FSMOne if transaction value exceeds S$11,000.
| Broker | Fees |
| POEMS Cash Plus Account | 0.08% per trade, no minimum |
| FSMOne | S$8.80 per trade |
When it comes to setting up a regular savings plan using your CPF or SRS funds, POEMS and FSMOne stand out as having the lowest fees.
If your RSP investment amount is $1,000 monthly, it will result in S$1 fees for both POEMS and FSMOne.
However, there will be a difference once your total investment increases, as POEMS calculates their fees as a percentage of the total portfolio value.
At the 10th month, POEMS would charge a monthly fee of S$2.50 (0.025% x S$10,000). FSMOne, on the other hand, would still charge the same fee of S$1 for your S$1,000 purchase in the month.

泡泡玛特,"Sold out rare Popmart Labubu monsters loved by celebs including Olivia Atwood being resold on eBay for up to £1,025 - The Sun",2025-04-09 07:00:00,"Sold out rare Popmart Labubu monsters loved by celebs including Olivia Atwood being resold on eBay for up to £1,025
A NEW plush toy has taken social media by storm, and now rare models are re-selling online for up to £1,000.
The Pop Mart Labubu monsters are beloved by celebrities including Olivia Attwood, who recently posted a viral video of herself unboxing one of the toys.
Dua Lipa and Rihanna are also fans of the plushies, which were designed by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung.
Olivia Attwood has begun featuring the dolls, which cost from around £30, in a number of her social media videos, leading to a surge in demand for the figurines.
Pop Mart is a Chinese toy retailer, known for its collectible designer models that are often sold in a blind box format. This means you don’t know what you’ve got until you’ve opened it.
After a whirlwind of success overseas, the craze has now hit the UK and Brits are desperate to get their hands on one.
More on money
Now, rare plushies are popping up on eBay, with one having sold for upwards of £1,000 and many others for twice their original value.
The most valuable and highly-sought-after plushie is the Pop Mart the Monsters Zimomo I Found You doll, which retails at £164 on the Pop Mart website, but is currently out of stock.
Collectibles retailer Novelship describes the toy as an ""exquisite collector's item"" that is ""perfect for enthusiasts of unique toys"".
The most valuable kind are brand new and sealed, meaning the boxes have never been opened.
Most read in Money
One sealed box of the doll sold on eBay for a whopping £1,025 in March this year - 525% more than its face value.
But not every listing has sold for this much - the next most expensive resale price for the sealed item is £321.71, which is around twice its face value.
Two unboxed versions of the toy, which still came with the box, sold in February and March for £297.12.
Two other unboxed listings for the doll sold for £245.12 and £234.99 in April and February, respectively.
The I Found You plushie is by far the most valuable toy being resold, with several active listings for over £1,000.
But the Catch Me If You Like Me series doll is also popular, with one unboxed toy selling in February for £256 against a retail price of around £78.
The toy is currently not available to buy on the UK version of Pop Mart's website, but in the US it is listed for $99 (£78).
Remember that an item on eBay is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
There are a number of Labubu dolls on sale for over £1,000, but only one doll has ever sold in the UK for that amount so far.
It's a good idea to base your listings on what similar items have previously sold for rather than what they are currently listed for.
However, as the dolls are growing in popularity, demand could increase and you may be more likely to make a mint if you're able to get your hands on one.
We recently explained why the new dolls have taken off and how to get your hands on one.
Top tips for selling on eBay
NEW to eBay? It's head of secondhand, Emma Grant, reveals how to optimise your listings:
- Use key words - eBay automatically filters listing titles for key words, so it's crucial to use the terminology people search for - especially brand and product names.
- Choose the right category for your product - It might sound obvious but it’s important to always choose the most specific category to sell in.
- Pictures are important - Most users will not bid on items they cannot see. For best results, take photos in natural light against a neutral background and be honest about any scratches or damage to the item.
- Be as detailed as possible - Be honest about the condition of the product and be sure to note any wear and tear.
- Look at past sold items- eBay has a function that allows you to search for the item you want to sell and then filter the results by sold items. Here, you can view the price the item has sold for and get insight into how others have listed it.
- Selling Sundays - Get the timing right. The busiest time for buyers is Sunday evenings, so schedule your listings to end around that time. Opt for seven-day auctions to ensure the max number of bids. The longer your item is listed, the more chance of people seeing it, so unless it's time-sensitive, pick seven days. December is the busiest month on eBay.
- Be realistic with pricing - Try searching for similar items on eBay, to make sure you’re going for the right price and always ask yourself ""would I pay this price for this item?""
- Donate to charity - When listing your item, consider donating a percentage of the sale to a cause of your choice – from 10% to 100% - you can donate the funds raised from your item straight from the platform.
Where to buy Labubu and how much they cost
The easiest place to get a Labubu doll is to buy one from the Pop Mart website.
They are also available in certain toy retailers around the UK, such as outlets on Oxford Street in London and in Manchester's China Town district.

A single model can cost anywhere from £13.50 to £211, depending on the rarity of the design.

MooMoo,8 Best Interactive Brokers Alternatives in April 2025 - Benzinga,2025-04-08 07:00:00,"Jump straight to it: The best alternative to Interactive Brokers is moomoo, which is offering up to 15 free stocks with a qualified deposit for new customers, as well as a massive 8.1% APY on idle cash for a limited time. That's all on top of other benefits like commission-free options trading.
If you're looking for an alternative to Interactive Brokers, you can find several options. Interactive Brokers is a brokerage platform that offers a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. You might be looking for an alternative because of higher fees, limited trading tools or a need for more educational resources. In this article, Benzinga explores seven Interactive Brokers alternatives and their pros and cons to help you make an informed decision.
8 Best Alternatives to Interactive Brokers
Whether it's fees, platform usability or customer service, these Interactive Brokers alternatives offer unique advantages that may better suit individual preferences and requirements.
1. Best Overall: Plus500

The new store will include limited edition items and other souvenirs. Pop Mart has a Strip location at the Fashion Show mall.
Fashion and intimate wear brand Calzedonia | Intimissimi will bring “European charm” to the center. The brand is known for their legwear, including hosier and leggings, as well as shapewear, clothing and swimwear.

More on moomoo
Moomoo is a stockbroker owned by Futu Holdings Ltd. and based in California. Moomoo's mission is relatively simple: Combine professional-grade tools with commission-free investing. Some of the many offerings moomoo has included in its desktop and mobile platforms include:
- Free Level 2 market data: Most brokers require their investors to pay an additional monthly or annual fee for access to Level 2 market data. Moomoo is one of the only brokers we've seen to offer this information for free to all investors who open a moomoo account.
- Custom push notifications: With mobile trading becoming more and more popular, you don't want to have to sit at your computer all day to monitor your investments. Moomoo offers a dynamic and completely customizable range of push notification options to be informed of preset market movements no matter where you are. Conditional alerts can even inform you when select assets change in price or reach a price target.
- Full stock screening capabilities: In addition to a holistic set of analysis tools and charting options, moomoo also gives investors access to a full-service stock screener. This is particularly useful for scalpers and day traders looking to analyze volume changes and movements before the market opens for the day.
- Cash Sweep Program: Get a 4.1% APY1 for your uninvested cash in the Cash Sweep Program.
- No commission: Save when you trade stocks and ETF trading.
You may appreciate moomoo's mobile app if you're looking for a comprehensive mobile trading experience that doesn't cut or water down features from its desktop offering.
Why moomoo Might Not Be Right for You
Though moomoo offers a range of benefits, it doesn't provide an all-in-one platform that's appropriate for all investors. If you value any of the following features, you'll want to choose another broker.
- No access to cryptocurrency markets: Though many investors' eyes have been on major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ, the cryptocurrency market has also made waves. If you're interested in the cryptocurrency market or you think that you might want to invest in assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum alongside your stocks and ETFs, you'll need to pick a broker that offers access to cryptocurrency trading. Moomoo currently doesn't support any type of cryptocurrency investing through its platform.
- Simple account management and order placements: Though moomoo does an amazing job offering a comprehensive desktop and mobile platform, its wealth of tools and analysis options can overwhelm new investors. If you've never traded before and you're okay with sacrificing some advanced features in favor of the easiest-to-master platform possible, moomoo may not be the best choice for you.
You can tap into a number of alternative brokers if moomoo isn't right for your unique needs.

Pop Mart,"1.4 billion RMB sold a year, is MINISO’s TOP TOY the next POP MART? - Dao Insights",2025-04-04 07:00:00,"Collectible toys and IP collaborations are some of the hottest topics now for consumers and investors alike. The leading toymaker in China, POP MART, released its annual report for 2024 and showed that it had earned 13.04 billion RMB (1.79 billion USD) in 2024, up 106.9% year-on-year (YoY). Revenue outside Mainland China increased 375.2% YoY, weighing 38.9% of the total income. Its market value jumped to over 200 billion HKD (25.71 billion USD) after the disclosure. Now TOP TOY, the designer toy brand from MINISO, is ready to take on POP MART, or is it?
TOP TOY was founded in 2020, the day after POP MART went public. Last year, the MINISO-owned brand earned 1.41 billion RMB (194 million USD) in gross merchandise value (GMV) and 980 million RMB (134.84 million USD) in revenue, growing 45% YoY and was profitable. The number of shops grew from 148 to 276 in 2024. It has also been reported that MINISO is considering listing TOP TOY after spinning off its collectible toy arm.
When asked, Sun Yuanwen (孙元文), founder and CEO of TOP TOY said that the brand does not consider POP MART a rival because he feels that POP MART works mostly with its own intellectual properties (IPs) such as MOLLY and LABUBU, but TOP TOY is a licensing/collaboration-centric toymaker. Indeed, last year, the brand launched over 40 IPs to create merch.
TOP TOY relies on MINISO for both the supply chain and channels. Abroad, its presence is often in the form of a store in a store inside MINISO shops. In this sense, TOP TOY is a platform for items from other IPs. This is why some commentators don’t consider it a real toymaker. TOP TOY announced recently that it had gathered over 10 billion RMB (1.37 billion USD) to open 1,000 stores globally in the next 5 years. How it competes with POP MART in and outside China is certainly worth watching closely.

MooMoo,9 Best Brokers for Short Selling in 2025 - Benzinga,2025-04-03 07:00:00,"Day traders who speculate on an upcoming decline often sell stocks short. But you can also use short sales to balance portfolio allocations and manage risk. That's one reason why you need the best brokers for short selling, such as Interactive Brokers and CenterPoint Securities.
When you sell stocks short, you borrow the stock from your stockbroker, then sell the borrowed stock in the market and leave an open short position. You close that short position by repurchasing the previously sold stock, hopefully for a profit.
As a short seller, you profit by buying back the sold shares at a lower price and making the difference between the sale price and the purchase price on each share. If the stock goes up, you wind up paying a higher price for the short stock and take a loss. Selling short also has some important rules.
Not all brokers are created equal, so carefully consider your needs before you open an account and start investing. Get started now with our recommended brokers for shorting a stock.

Why Short Selling Is Important
Short selling plays an important part in the liquidity of the stock market. If a stock becomes overvalued according to the market, then short sellers borrow shares to sell the stock down, thereby aligning stock prices to their fair value.
The practice of short selling combines the opinions of both bulls and bears to arrive at an equitable price for stock. Short selling provides other benefits to the market including greater liquidity, which increases the opportunities for short-term traders like scalpers and day traders.
Remember, the share price that you hone in on is not stable. You're likely not operating as a market maker and you're not running a hedge fund. However, you know that there's a specific market price at which you're willing to short.
More liquidity also leads to tighter bid/offer spreads that reduce overall costs to active day traders. In addition, shorting stocks increases capital formation and lowers the likelihood of bubbles and crashes due to the increased efficiency and more accurate pricing in the market.
With respect to large investors, fund managers allocate funds efficiently and hedge against long-term investment strategies. In combination with futures and options, shorting stock could be integrated into numerous highly profitable day trading strategies, including arbitrage and momentum trading.
How to Choose
The best brokers for short selling typically either have a large inventory of stock through their pool of customers or access to a stock loaner that could provide the stock for short sellers.
Here are a few more things to look into:
- Most large stockbrokers can obtain considerable amounts of stock through their big institutional clients and have whole departments dedicated to facilitating stock loans.
- Smaller and less capitalized brokers may not be able to provide every stock to short and therefore may put restrictions on short sales.
- If you have limited assets, also consider the broker's margin account. You need a margin account in order to borrow shares from a broker. Stockholders and traders generally allow the broker to borrow their stocks and other holdings as collateral for existing margin debt balances, and that is one of the main ways brokers borrow stock. For example, Charles Schwab can borrow stock worth as much as 140% of the debit balance amount from a client's margin account but can't borrow securities that are settled and paid in full.
- An interface you understand makes the investment journey that much simpler. If you're spending your money in a place that confuses you, it's only a matter of time before you make a mistake or miscalculate your investment.
Frequently Asked Questions

- Markets are messy—but the right setups can still deliver triple-digit gains. Join Matt Maley live this Wednesday at 6 PM ET to see how he’s trading it.
The New York Mets have started the 2025 Major League Baseball season with a 3-3 record. Investors could soon be rooting for the team to hit the 100-win milestone thanks to a new multimillion-dollar sponsorship.
What Happened: Trading platform moomoo announced a new strategic partnership with the Mets on Thursday that could award one lucky customer $1 million.

To celebrate the partnership, moomoo is offering cash prizes for customers based on the number of wins the Mets reach in the 2025 season.
Moomoo will pay out $1 million to one investor if the Mets win 100 games during the season. That potential grand prize drawing will take place on Sept. 28, 2025. Moomoo will also pay out prizes of $10,000 for 25 wins, $20,000 for 50 wins and $30,000 for 75 wins if the Mets reach those milestones.
The contest is open to people living in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut who open a moomoo account and place a deposit or mail a postcard to moomoo.
""We are very excited to partner with New York Mets, not only because I am a baseball fan, but also because we are committed to elevating the fan experience through various interactive games and promotions,"" moomoo's U.S. CEO Neil McDonald said.
The tagline ""from bullpen to bull-market, moomoo, your powerful trading platform"" will be used for the sponsorship and promotion.

As for the Mets chances of 100 wins, sportsbooks predict the team to be one of the top MLB teams in the 2025 season.
At DraftKings Inc DKNG, the Mets have the fifth-best odds of winning the World Series at +1,400. At FanDuel, which is owned by Flutter Entertainment FLUT, the over/under on the Mets wins for the season currently sits at 91.5, suggesting a likely total of 92 wins.
Last season, the Mets went 89-73 and made the playoffs. There were seven teams with 90 wins last season, but none eclipsed the 100-win plateau with the Los Angeles Dodgers closest at 98 wins.
The Mets have won 100 or more games several times in their history, including going 101-61 in 2022 and winning 100 or more in 1988, 1986 and 1969.

MooMoo,I’m Obsessed With Mario Kart World’s Newest Character - Screen Rant,2025-04-03 07:00:00,"Something we never knew we needed is coming to the next racing game by Nintendo, Mario Kart World. A currently unnamed cow racer was revealed in the latest trailer for the game. The majestic bovine was spotted driving and performing tricks in the middle of the trailer. While the trailer did reveal other intriguing new details about Mario Kart World, they pale in comparison to being able to play as one of the Moo Moo Meadows cows.
The latest Nintendo Direct showed off the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, announced a plethora of third-party games, and revealed more details about its first launch title, Mario Kart World. This title includes new vehicles, like snowmobiles and jet skis, and practically endless exploration. Among the racers revealed was an adorable cow, an addition that shows how Nintendo is still keeping its games the perfect amount of weird.
Mario Kart World Is Introducing A Playable Cow Driver
Time To Get Moo-ving
Introduced alongside classic Mario Kart racers like Princess Peach, Toad, and Wario in the latest trailer for Mario Kart World was a cow. Due to the fact that the cow was spotted doing a montage of established characters driving their bikes and carts, it’s safe to assume that this cow will be a playable character in the upcoming title, which may be the most exciting fact about the game yet.
Mario Kart World Costs $80 And The Internet Is Unhappy
After its new gameplay and release date reveal, Mario Kart World is revealed to cost $80, and the internet is not happy about this price tag.
If this specific cow seems familiar, it’s because it seems to be one of the many cows that wander across the fields and tracks of Moo Moo Meadows in Mario Kart Wii. In fact, the shots that introduce the currently unnamed cow character take place on a course that looks exactly like Moo Moo Meadows, which could mean a new version of the farm-themed course might come to Mario Kart World.
The Moo Moo Meadows Cow Is The Perfect Weird Nintendo Addition
Strange Characters Are A Nintendo Staple
Nintendo is always at its best when it’s a little weird. Strange characters and choices in their main franchises have led to some fan favorites over the years. Despite being incredibly off-putting at first, Tingle from The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask has become a fan favorite. Similarly, the Piranha Plant was a late addition to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which was certainly weird, and though Piranha Plant isn’t the strongest fighter, it is still a popular character for its novelty.
The new cow in Mario Kart World could become a fan favorite for players who want to stray away from the classics.
Like those fun characters in other Nintendo titles, the new cow in Mario Kart World could become a fan favorite for players who want to stray away from the classics (Mario and Luigi), don’t want to take other popular alternatives (Toad and Yoshi), and definitely don’t want to play as one of Bowser’s many Koopalings (Larry, Morton, Iggy, Roy, Ludwig, Lemmy, and Wendy) avaliable in Mario Kart World.

What's the best way to start share trading?
Before you start, it pays to understand how share trading works. Read our guide to share trading for beginners, or browse some of the resources on the ASX website. It’s also a good idea to brush up on how interest rates, exchange rates and government policy can affect the share market.
Once you’re confident in your knowledge, you can open an account with a share trading platform and start placing orders. The size of each order will be up to you, but most brokers will require your first trade to be at least $500 (this is known as the 'minimum marketable parcel of shares').
Keep in mind that each transaction will incur a brokerage fee, and if you buy only a small amount the fee will make up a larger percentage of your total investment. That means you might be waiting longer for your returns to even cover the cost of purchasing the asset.
Is share trading risky?
Yes, share trading can be risky. The value of your shares can rise and fall over time, meaning there’s always a chance you could get back less money than you originally put in. And if you invest in a single company and it goes bankrupt, you could lose all of your initial outlay.
While there’s no way to completely eliminate the risk involved in share trading, there are ways to minimise it. For example, it’s recommended that you diversify your portfolio by spreading funds across a range of industries and asset classes, instead of honing in on just one or two.
As always, it pays to do plenty of research - on any particular asset you might be thinking of buying and on share trading in general - so that you have a clear idea of the risks involved.
What's the best way I can invest in international shares?
Many share trading platforms offer access to share markets in the USA, with some providing access to markets elsewhere in the world. Exchange rates on currencies will usually be built into the price for any trades within these apps.
How do I know my shares are secure?
If your brokerage platform is CHESS sponsored, you will be issued a Holder Identification Number (HIN) when you sign up. This is a tag that is unique to you, and any shares you buy will be attached to it.
This is much more preferable than a custodian model, where the shares you buy are held on your behalf under an “omnibus” HIN. While brokers that rely on a custodian model tend to be cheaper, there are tradeoffs. For one, you won’t technically own your shares, which unfortunately means you’ll be granted fewer protections.
Other measures you can take to ensure your shares stay in your possession include using two-factor authentication (if the platform you use offers it), which adds an additional layer of security to your portfolio.
What is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)?
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a managed fund that tracks a particular index, sector or commodity. ETFs can be thought of as a bundle of shares or assets, and are appreciated by investors for the diversification they offer along with their relatively low management fees. Like shares, ETFs can be bought or sold on a stock exchange.
What is dollar cost averaging?
An alternative to trying to predict future market price movements, dollar cost averaging involves regularly investing the same amount of money in an asset, regardless of price, over an extended period of time.
The idea is that by buying when the market is both up and down, you can reduce the average cost of shares bought.
How so? Since the amount of shares you can buy with a fixed sum of money is lower when the price is high, dollar cost averaging lets you buy more shares when they’re cheap and fewer shares when they’re expensive.
Are these share trading platforms best for me?
We have highlighted some of our editor’s picks and products which have earned our seal of approval through the Mozo Experts Choice Awards^. Ultimately, you will need to consider your priorities as an investor to identify which options are best for you. Be sure to read the information provided on a product issuer’s website before making a decision.
Is share trading ethical?
When you invest, you'll have to decide for yourself if what you're investing in (in other words, supporting financially) aligns with your ethics.
For example, choosing to buy shares in a fossil-fuel mining company may be unethical to you if you're concerned about climate change and the impact such companies have on the environment.
Luckily, there are still ways to invest in ethically-minded companies and industries. One such way is by looking into ESG funds, which are all about getting you maximum returns and maximum ethical impact.
There are also plenty of ETFs out there which claim to invest with an ethical frame of mind.
How to make money buying and selling shares?
If you want to make money from buying and selling your stocks, then the basic principal is to 'buy low, sell high'.
In other words, you want to aim to sell your positions when the price is higher than what you bought them for.

MooMoo,Hometown Eats: Moo Moo’s Delights - WDBJ,2025-04-03 07:00:00,"Hometown Eats: Moo Moo’s Delights
Moo Moo’s Delights is located at 1432 Roanoke Rd, Daleville, VA
DALEVILLE, Va. (WDBJ) - Retirement for some doesn’t always mean sitting around watching the days go by. In fact, there’s a couple in Daleville who haven’t missed a beat since trading their careers for the cows. We’re getting the scoop on Moo Moo’s Delights in this week’s Hometown Eats!
“They come in as strangers, they leave as friends. They come back as friends and leave as family. I just love it,” said Moo Moo’s Delights owner Kathy Crawford.
Just follow the cow hoof prints and they’ll lead you to more than 30 flavors of frozen treats with a friendly wave. Welcome to Moo Moo’s Delights in the Botetourt Plaza on Route 220 in Daleville.
“Every town needs an ice cream shop,” said Moo Moo’s Delights owner Jeff Crawford.
Owners Jeff and Kathy Crawford haven’t spent a lifetime in the ice cream career, but they like many of us, love a scoop of the good stuff.
“One of the biggest rewards you see is when you give a small child an ice cream cone and their face lights up,” said Jeff.
It wasn’t until after retirement in October 2023 when Kathy started working in this same space under a different owner that the cows came home. A few months later, she and Jeff had an opportunity to become the big cheese.
“It closed down at the end of December. We talked about it and decided if this becomes available, maybe we need to act on this,” said Jeff.
“He saw the lease available, and he took a picture of it, I called the owner, and the rest is history,” added Kathy.
“We took possession of the shop on February 1 and opened up 27 days later,” said Jeff.
“We got our name because we’re out in the rural area and moo moos are everywhere, and we just felt it was a fit for the community,” joked Kathy.
The first thing you’ll notice, both out and inside Moo Moo’s are the cows. They’re everywhere, even on Jeff and Kathy’s clothing.
“We can’t work for moo moo without a uniform like this and customers love it,” said Kathy.
Customers also love the choices, which is also a problem, but it’s a good one to have.
“One of our biggest complaints is we have too many flavors,” said Jeff.
“Oh gosh! There’s too many! I try something different every time I come in, I think,” said regular customer Susan.
“Over 32 it’s like wow this is the big problem,” said Kathy.
I mean, who doesn’t love a good banana split, but don’t think it’s just ice cream in this little shop. You’ll find Nathan’s beef hot dogs and North Carolina-style barbecue.
“With the combo you get either a hot dog or a barbecue or we can mix and match if you get a two-sandwich combo. Martin’s potato chips, bottle of water or soft drink and a scoop of ice cream in a cup or a cake cone,” explained Jeff.
Make sure to wash it down with the huge Cowabunga shake.
While you wait on your order to check out some of the goodies Moo Moo’s has to offer, like bracelets with bible verses, locally made ice cream scoops, stuffed cows, and hats for both you and your dog.
“We get people traveling to come in, we get people from the Appalachian Trail to come by. It’s just amazing the people we’ve met,” said Kathy.
“A lot of these friends feel like family now, so everybody feels welcome here,” said Jeff.
“You need to come. It’s great,” said Susan.
Even working beyond their retirement, both Jeff and Kathy know they are right where they’re meant to be.
“The thing that my husband and I say a lot is we serve cups of joy. I want to be the hands and feet of Jesus. So, if this is where he wants me right here at an ice cream shop, that’s great for us,” said Kathy.
Moo Moo’s Delights, a hometown eat serving endless combos of joy.
Moo Moo’s Delights is located at 1432 Roanoke Rd, Daleville, VA 24083 and is open Wednesday and Thursday 12 to 7pm, Friday and Saturday 12 to 8pm, Sunday 2 to 8pm.

Who Should Use moomoo?
Moomoo is a highly specialized investment app with a focus on international investing.
Moomoo provides investors access to the U.S., Hong Kong, and Chinese A-Shares markets. It’s a perfect way to gain low-cost access to both Asian markets. Moomoo’s Cash Sweep Account pays one of the highest interest rates on uninvested cash.
However, moomoo isn’t for everyone. It doesn’t support mutual funds or fixed-income investments. Also, moomoo is only designed for individual taxable brokerage accounts. It’s not suitable if you want to open a joint investment account, or any type of tax-sheltered retirement account, trust account, custodial account, or education-related account.

What Is Moomoo?
Moomoo is a global stock trading platform that lets you invest in stocks, ADRs, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and equity options without a commission (index options cost $0.50 per contract). Regulatory fees, such as SEC and FINRA pass-through fees, apply for sells only. There are currently no platform fees for the U.S. market.
Securities are offered through Moomoo Financial Inc, which is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You can review their records on FINRA’s BrokerCheck (CRD#: 283078/SEC#: 8-69739). They are headquartered at 550 S. California Ave, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94306 and have been established since 2015 – which is far older than I thought since they are relatively new to me. They are licensed in 53 U.S. States and Territories.
Moomoo Financial Inc. is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). SIPC coverage does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.
Types of Accounts
You can only open an individual, taxable brokerage account with moomoo. Joint accounts, retirement, custodial, trust, or business accounts are not supported.
The platform is available for both desktop and mobile users. There is no minimum initial investment required to open an account, nor are there any trade minimums.
Investments Offered
Moomoo offers U.S. stocks – including over-the-counter (OTC) stocks – American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs (for the purchase of foreign stocks), ETFs, options, and index options. Unfortunately, you can’t purchase mutual funds or fixed-income securities.
However, Moomoo does offer a high yield on its Cash Sweep Account. It has a regular rate of 5.1% APY on uninvested cash up to $1 million, but it is currently paying 8.1% APY on up to $20,000 for the first three months after the 3% boost coupon is activated.
Moomoo Cash Sweep Account
Moomoo’s Cash Sweep Account pays a base rate of 5.10% APY on uninvested cash. There is no minimum balance requirement or fees connected with the account. Meanwhile, Cash Sweep account balances are FDIC-insured for up to $1 million at partner banks.
BONUS RATE: The Cash Sweep Account is currently paying a booster rate of 3% above the regular APY of 5.1%. That means depositors can earn an incredible 8.1% on their uninvested cash. The enhanced rate is good for three months after account activation.
Investment Research and Tools
Moomoo accountholders have 24/7 access to financial news from more than 200 news sources. As an investor on the platform, you’ll also enjoy social media access to millions of Moomoo users worldwide.

Level 2 Data
Moomoo offers Level 2 data, which helps to evaluate support and resistance levels, measure stocks’ liquidity, better understand bid-ask spreads, and enhance overall trading timing capabilities.
Level 2 data is available for all U.S.-listed securities, and is free for Moomoo customers for 30 days. After the initial offer expires, access to Level 2 data will continue to be available free of charge with a minimum 30-day average account value of $100.

Moomoo Mobile App
Moomoo’s mobile app is available for Android users through Google Play and for iOS devices on The App Store. It provides identical capabilities to the web-based version.
The app has received 4.6 out of five stars among over 20,000 iOS users and 4.5 out of five stars among over 20,000 Android users.

Moomoo also employs multifactor authentication to provide extra protection for your account
Alternatives vs. Moomoo
Public
Public offers a wider selection of investments than moomoo. For example, while both allow you to invest in stocks, ETFs, and options, Public supports over 25 cryptocurrencies.
Public also offers a limited number of opportunities to participate in collectibles. However, you cannot access stocks on either the Hong Kong or the Chinese A-Shares markets. And while Moomoo can accommodate high-frequency trading, like day trading, Public is not set up for that activity.
Like moomoo, Public is currently offering 5.1% APY through its high-yield cash account. It also offers commission-free trades.
Learn more in our full review of Public.
Webull
Webull provides up to 12 free stocks when you open a new account, and will also reimburse up to $100 in transfer fees if you transfer at least $2,000 from a competing broker.
The two platforms are similar in other ways. Webull offers commission-free trading of stocks, options, and ETFs, and doesn’t offer mutual funds or fixed-income investments.
While Webull does offer a high-interest cash option – currently paying 5.0% APY – it does not offer the 3.0% rate enhancement for the first three months like Moomoo does.
Learn more in our full Webull review.
Robinhood
Robinhood provides fast-paced, commission-free trading and a high-yield cash option, currently paying 5.00% APY on uninvested cash. Robinhood doesn’t offer an enhanced APY like Moomoo, but it does provide a cash card with similar benefits to a checking account.
You can’t access the Hong Kong or Chinese A-Shares markets through Robinhood. However, it has other advantages over Moomoo, including commission-free cryptocurrency trades and participation in a limited number of pre-IPO stocks.
Robinhood stands with its IRA offering. Robinhood provides a matching contribution of between 1% and 3% of the investor’s contribution to a traditional or a Roth IRA account. Moomoo doesn’t support IRA accounts.

FAQs
Yes. Moomoo is a registered member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and a member of SIPC. Cash deposits held on the platform are FDIC-insured through participating banks. The company is also highly regarded by thousands of mobile app participants.
No. Moomoo is a subsidiary of Futu, a financial services company based in Palo Alto, California. However, the app allows users to trade stocks listed on several Asian markets, including China. The company has multiple international offices, including Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
There is no cost to open an account with Moomoo and no minimum opening deposit. However, you must deposit a minimum of $100 to be eligible for the free stock offer.
Moomoo is a limited trading platform that allows you to make commission-free trades in U.S. stocks, options, and ETFs. The platform also gives you access to stocks on both the Hong Kong and the Chinese A-Shares markets.
Summary
Moomoo is worth considering if you are a non-U.S. resident who wants access to U.S. stock markets, or any investor also wants access to either the Hong Kong or the Chinese A-Shares stock markets. The cash option is also attractive, with its standard rate of 5.1% APY, and the 3% enhancement for the first three months.
However, if you want to trade mutual funds, fixed-income, or cryptocurrencies, or invest in tax-advantaged accounts, you’ll want to look elsewhere.

* Fees are different in different country and regions, kindly refer to official websites.
Pros
- Commission-free trading in stocks, ETFs, and Options
- Many assets to choose from
- Premium-level research tools
- Customer service via email, online chat and phone call.
Cons
- Deposit and withdrawal fees rather high
Trust
Despite the fact that the company itself is relatively new, Moomoo has quickly gained a reputation as a very trustworthy place to trade. This is due to a number of factors beyond them only being in existence since 2018. The first of these is that they are a subsidiary of Futu Holdings Limited which is a NASDAQ listed company in the United States.
If you are a US trader, you will be further insured for as much as $500,000 under the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). The only point to keep in mind is that you will not be covered by negative balance protection. This means you could, in theory, lose more than you deposit.
Investment Products
You will find the main focus of Moomoo is on US stocks, ETFs, and Options. There are many assets offered by the company for commission-free trading with a number of unique features also in place.
The range of stocks available to trade through Moomoo is predominantly US-focused with thousands to choose from. This is a similar number to most main competitors in the space, including Robinhood. Stocks from a total of 5 markets are currently offered including some from Hong Kong and China exchanges.
ETF and options trading is also offered. The markets available for these are much the same as the Moomoo stock offering. Many are US-based while there are also some Hong Kong and Chinese assets available. IPO stock subscription for upcoming offerings and access is also possible.
Commissions and Fees
Moomoo offers completely commission-free trading on US stocks and options in U.S. This means, much like other low-cost providers, you will pay almost nothing in fees. The only costs you have to consider in trading are extremely minimal. The SEC transaction fee on sell orders is $0.0000207, FINRA has a trading activity fee of $0.000119, and there is a custodian fee of $0.01 to $0.05 per share on ADR trades. Options trading has similar negligible fees.
There are some fees to consider for bank wire transfer deposits. A domestic wire transfer in the US will typically cost $8 unless it is your first, or you are depositing more than $25,000. International wire transfers will be $25 with the same conditions. International wire withdrawals will cost $45, domestic is $25 per withdrawal.
There is no inactivity fee charged by the broker, and the only supported base currency at the moment is the US Dollar.
Trading Platforms
There is a desktop and mobile trading platform available at Moomoo. Both of these platforms provide a very intuitive and user-friendly trading experience while combining some more advanced trading features that are very popular with more experienced traders. The mobile trading platform is compatible with iOS and Android devices, while the desktop platform is Windows compatible with both English and Chinese language support.
The platform layout in both forms is very clear and easy to navigate. You will find just one-step convenient log-in for both types, and both are extremely easy to both customize and search with a great degree of technical and fundamental information accessible to provide as much insight as possible.
Pre and Post market trading is available through an array of advanced smart orders that help to put Moomoo a step ahead. You will also be able to break down the market with a wide variety of charting tools and trading indicators accessible across several timeframes. . This kind of research data is usually charged for at many other brokers and services but is provided free of charge by Moomoo.
Customer Support
Moomoo customer support can be contacted by email, phone support and web-based live chat function.
With that said, the responses of the support team were both professional and fast with the email service or online service seeming to operate on a 24/7 basis, and fast responses to phone inquiry in trading days. They also provide a useful help center through their website. This can help answer many of the most common questions you might have without needing to contact the support team.
Education
When it comes to education, there are some resources made available at Moomoo. These are all written guides that are reasonably basic and easy to follow. They cover a number of key topics that will be helpful to traders, particularly when starting out in the industry.
A demo account is made available by Moomoo. This can be extremely useful if you are a new trader, or simply new to a broker. It is a chance to develop your skills and also get to know what is on offer with no risk or obligation since you are trading virtual funds.
Summary
In all, there are many positives to reflect on with Moomoo. They work hard to keep costs as low as possible and provide a good deal of choice for you in trading commission-free stocks, ETFs, and options.

MooMoo,4 Best Brokers for Buying & Trading Penny Stocks: 2025 Picks - NerdWallet,2025-04-01 07:00:00,"4 Best Brokers to Buy Penny Stocks: 2025 Picks
Penny stocks are low-priced securities that trade for less than $5 a share. Wondering where to buy them? It's a good question: Not all brokers offer them, and those that do may charge higher fees. Here are the best brokers for trading penny stocks.

Penny stocks are risky, low-cost investments, though they don’t actually cost a penny. They are shares of small companies that trade outside of major stock exchanges, and are also known as over-the-counter (OTC) stocks.
The precise definition of penny stocks will vary by broker. Some consider anything trading under $5 to be a penny stock, while others put the cutoff at $2 or $1. (For more on penny stock trading, see our article on investing in penny stocks.)
Penny stocks may seem like a steal when stacked against companies that trade for $500 or more. This is where the backstory is important: These stocks are cheap for a reason. Because they are issued by small, yet-to-be-established companies, penny stock values can be turbulent. They are often hard to research and accurately value, and they trade infrequently, which means they can be tough to sell. (Here are other ways to find cheap stocks beyond penny stocks.)
Long story short, many brokers are a bit antsy about penny stock trading. This can make figuring out where to buy penny stocks more challenging than other investments. Below are NerdWallet’s picks for the top brokerages for penny stock traders. These four brokers don't impose any additional fees or investment restrictions on domestic penny stocks.

Choosing a penny stock broker
In case the above didn’t make this clear: There are significant risks that come with trading penny stocks, unless you are a sophisticated investor and you understand this market. You'll also want to be aware of the following when selecting an online broker to trade penny stocks:
Additional fees: Most of the brokers we review have eliminated trading commissions for stocks, so long as those stocks are well-established and trade on major U.S. exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq. But many brokers still charge some kind of trading fee for OTC stocks and foreign stocks that aren't officially listed on U.S. exchanges. Only a few brokers are commission-free for penny stock traders, but we've made our list exclusive to brokers that don't charge commissions.
Limited penny stock selection: Some brokers only offer a small selection of relatively-established OTC stocks to investors, and others only offer one-off penny stock trades on request. If you're looking to trade especially-obscure penny stocks, you may find that many brokers don't allow access to them.

Methodology
NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks the largest U.S. brokers by assets under management, along with emerging industry players. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for editorial integrity.
We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).
This list is based on our OTC access score, which measures the size of a broker's OTC stock selection, whether OTC stocks are subject to additional fees, and whether OTC trades are available by default or have to be requested. Merrill Edge, Moomoo, SoFi Active Investing and Robinhood are the only brokers we review that earned the highest possible score in this category, meaning that they offer an unlimited selection of domestic OTC stocks to all users without any additional fees.

Sirio Pharma,Sirio advances anti-aging science with new research institute - NutraIngredients.com,2025-04-01 07:00:00,"The Sirio Institute for Anti-Ageing (SIA), guided by Dr. Yu-Xuan Lyu from the Southern University of Science and Technology (Shenzhen, China), will focus on four core areas: cellular health, probiotics and gut health, muscle health and reproductive health.
“Research in these areas is designed to identify and validate bioactive compounds that can effectively target the biological mechanisms underlying these processes,” Dr. Lyu told NutraIngredients.
“By exploring how cellular resilience can be improved, how gut health can influence systemic inflammation and how nutrient formulations can prevent sarcopenia and hormonal imbalances, the Institute aims to develop cutting-edge nutraceutical solutions with clinically proven efficacy.”
Identifying a gap in the market
These four key areas play a pivotal role in modulating the aging process, with each possessing the ability to not only enhance longevity but also overall health span, according to Dr. Lyu.
“Cellular health is central to longevity as it impacts mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and inflammation [which are] key drivers of aging,” he said. “Probiotics and gut health have emerged as critical modulators of the gut microbiome, which has been linked to immunity, metabolic health and longevity.
“Muscle health is a priority due to the growing prevalence of sarcopenia, which affects quality of life and mobility in older adults. And finally, reproductive system health, with a particular focus on mitigating ovarian functional decline, is vital for addressing the complex hormonal changes that occur during aging.”
While research in each of these areas is booming, there is a “critical gap in the market” for anti-aging solutions that are scientifically validated, according to Dr. Youyou Zhao, Sirio’s assistant vice president, global head of research and development, and chief scientist.
“Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of preventive health strategies and are seeking products backed by robust scientific and clinical evidence,” she told NutraIngredients. “This shift in consumer preferences has been driven by a desire to maintain vitality and extend health span, with a growing emphasis on products targeting cellular health, gut microbiome balance and musculoskeletal support.”
Dr. Zhao says the establishment of the SIA is therefore a direct response to the demand for rigorously researched, high-efficacy, anti-aging formulations.
Ensuring people live longer, healthier lives
With manufacturing sites in Europe, the United States and Asia, Dr. Zhao expects the SIA to have a “significant impact” on the global nutraceutical market but particularly within Europe where a rapidly aging population is driving demand for longevity-focused solutions.
In a crowded market, Sirio plans to stand out with solutions that go beyond delaying the surface-level, visible effects of aging, Dr. Zhao said.
“As the European market continues to shift toward evidence-based nutraceuticals, SIA’s work will enable Sirio’s partners to gain a competitive edge by offering products that combine best-in-class organoleptic properties with scientifically validated efficacy,” she explained.
In doing so, Sirio aims to develop nutraceuticals that identify and modulate the fundamental mechanisms of aging, enabling people to enjoy longer, healthier lives.","[{'head': 'Sirio Institute for Anti-Ageing', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'assistant_vice_president', 'tail': 'Youyou Zhao'}, {'head': 'Sirio Institute for Anti-Ageing', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'CEO', 'tail': 'Yu-Xuan Lyu'}]","['institute', 'the sirio institute', 'zhao', 'yu-xuan lyu', 'sia', 'lyu', 'youyou zhao', 'the southern university of science and technology', 'nutraingredients', 'sirio']","- The Sirio Institute for Anti-Ageing (SIA), led by Dr. Yu-Xuan Lyu, will research cellular health, probiotics, muscle health, and reproductive health to develop nutraceutical solutions.

Pop Mart,My Take | Labubu proves Hong Kong IP and Chinese manufacturing are a recipe for success - South China Morning Post,2025-04-01 07:00:00,"My Take | With Labubu, Molly, China’s Pop Mart gives Hong Kong creativity a broader audience
The blind-box retailer’s mass-market toys based on cute Hong Kong designs are fuelling its international rise – and setting a template
In the decade since Hong Kong-born artist Lung Ka-sing created Labubu, an adorable, toothy elfin creature, it had remained a niche favourite in art circles until late 2024, when it became a mainstream sensation across mainland China and other parts of Asia.
While its sudden popularity is often attributed to Lisa, a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, who was spotted carrying various iterations of the doll, the real force behind the Labubu boom is Pop Mart, the Chinese blind-box company that became the brand’s sole mass-market distributor in 2019. China’s unparalleled toy production value chain, which can quickly turn designs into mass-produced items, also contributed to its success.
These conditions allowed Lung’s idea for a fluffy, rabbit-eared elf with serrated teeth and a mischievous grin to reach millions of fans. According to Pop Mart founder Wang Ning, the company adopted the material of Sofubi, a type of figure made from soft vinyl, to make the figures’ faces more engaging. It is a key attraction that has helped Labubu stand out.
It is one thing for a talented artist to create something original, but quite another to turn that design into a successful brand. Consider Ub Iwerks, the genius cartoonist who drew the first Mickey Mouse. His Steamboat Willie design was appealing, but it took the corporate muscle of Walt Disney to transform it into a pop culture phenomenon for a global audience.
Pop Mart reported that revenues from The Monsters line, to which Labubu belongs, surged over 720 per cent year on year to 3 billion yuan in 2024, making the brand the largest contributor to the blind-box retailer’s revenues. This exceeded Molly, another popular toy line based on a character designed by Hong Kong artist Kenny Wong.
Pop Mart’s revenues more than doubled last year, with a gross profit margin of 67 per cent, making the Hong Kong-listed firm the hottest pick for investors. Its stock price has more than quadrupled in the last 12 months, and its global expansion has been impressive, with overseas revenues surging 375 per cent last year, far exceeding the 52 per cent growth it saw in China.","[{'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'sole_mass_market_distributor', 'tail': 'Labubu'}, {'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'founder', 'tail': 'Wang Ning'}]","['labubu', 'lisa', 'blackpink', 'pop mart', 'monsters', 'lung', 'walt disney', 'kenny wong', 'molly', 'pop mart’s', 'ub iwerks', 'mickey mouse', 'sofubi', 'wang ning', 'lung ka-sing']","- The Labubu toy, created by Hong Kong artist Lung Ka-sing, gained mainstream popularity in late 2024, largely due to Pop Mart's mass-market distribution.

- Labubu's revenue increased over 720% year-on-year in 2024, contributing significantly to Pop Mart's overall revenues which doubled.

MooMoo,moomoo Offering 8.1% APY On Your Univested Cash - The College Investor,2025-04-01 07:00:00,"When it comes to building wealth, locking in a high rate of return is appealing. In general, savers and investors have to take on a higher level of risk in order to unlock potentially higher returns.
But with moomoo’s current offer, you can earn up to 8.1% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on your uninvested cash. This offer was so popular they are brining it back for the third time this year!
That’s better than you can earn on almost every savings account product out there currently! In partnership with moomoo, let’s take a closer look at the offer details and see how you can take advantage of this offer.
Earn Up To 8.1% APY
moomoo is offering up to 8.1%* APY for new users enrolled in their Cash Sweep Program who deposit cash and leave it uninvested within their accounts. You must open your first moomoo account by June 3, 2025 to take advantage!

While there is no minimum deposit threshold, moomoo is capping the maximum deposit amount at $20,000 to earn the promotional rate. With that, you can earn up to 8.1% on $20,000. Beyond $20,000 you’d default back to the 4.1% APY, which is still a solid interest rate.

Revenue from Mainland China amounted to 7.97 billion RMB, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 52.3%, while revenue from markets outside mainland China, including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, reached 5.07 billion RMB, up 375.2% year-on-year. The Group's operational metrics significantly surpassed expectations, setting new performance records.
In 2024, POP MART's intellectual property (IP) operation system reached new levels of maturity, notably with four key properties, THE MONSTERS, MOLLY, SKULLPANDA, and CRYBABY. These characters collectively generated revenue exceeding 1 billion RMB. Additionally, combined revenue from 13 other IPs, including popular figures such as DIMOO WORLD, HIRONO, Zsiga, and HACIPUPU surpassed 3 billion RMB, with remarkable growth below.
In 2024, IPs from POP MART's original studio Pop Design Center (PDC), most notably HIRONO, Zsiga, Nyota, and inosoul, all delivered exceptional performance. HIRONO alone achieved revenue of 730 million RMB, reflecting year-on-year growth of 106.9%. Meanwhile, Peach Riot, an IP by North American artist Libby, continued to make a significant impact in international markets. The newly signed IP, Twinkle Twinkle, despite being launched for less than a year, indicates strong market acceptance and growth.
The company achieved substantial organic growth in its brick-and-mortar business without significantly increasing the number of stores, while the online segment also experienced remarkable expansion.
In 2024, POP MART sustained its growth momentum in international markets by steadily expanding its flagship stores, further enhancing the brand's global recognition and influence. Revenue from markets outside Mainland China, including Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and other international regions, increased by 375.2% year-on-year to 5.07 billion RMB, with the share of total revenue rising to 38.9%. The number of brick-and-mortar stores grew to 130 (including joint ventures), while the number of ROBOSHOPs climbed to 192 (including joint ventures and franchises).
In 2024, POP MART opened its first brick-and-mortar outlets in Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, and Spain, while establishing a presence in several iconic locations worldwide, including inside the Louvre in Paris, France, on Oxford Street in London, UK, and at Sun World Ba Na Hills in Da Nang, Vietnam. Since rolling out its globalization roadmap in 2018, POP MART's business footprint has expanded to encompass nearly 100 countries and regions worldwide.
In 2024, POP MART reorganized its product lineup into four distinct categories for the first time. According to the financial report, the annual revenue from figures reached 6.94 billion RMB, showing a year-on-year increase of 44.7%, though their share of total revenue declined to 53.2%. Plush toys experienced explosive growth, with revenue amounting to 2.83 billion RMB, up 1289% year-on-year and accounting for 21.7% of the total revenue. The MEGA COLLECTION brand entered a mature operational stage, generating revenue of 1.68 billion RMB, an increase of 146.1% year-on-year. Revenue from derivatives and other products also saw a significant rise to 1.59 billion RMB year-on-year to 156.2%. POP MART has effectively identified optimal development strategies for its various IPs, focusing on implementing customized growth initiatives.
In tandem with its broad business expansion, POP MART achieved consistent improvements in key operational metrics, including gross profit margin, net profit margin, and inventory turnover, underscoring its strong operational efficiency and profitability.
In 2024, the company's gross profit margin hit a record 66.8%, up by 5.5 percentage points from 61.3% in 2023. Inventory turnover days decreased from 133 days in 2023 to 102 days in 2024, further showcasing the company's enhanced operational capabilities.

Pop Mart,Inside Pop Mart’s Global Toy Takeover - AOL.com,2025-03-26 07:00:00,"Inside Pop Mart’s Global Toy Takeover

For years, products stamped with a “Made in China” label have been associated with kitschiness, mass production, and poor quality, in part because global demand for cheap generic products turned China into a factory for the world.
But for Claire Carrillo, one Chinese branded product is worth travelling distances, waiting hours in lines, and breaking open her wallet for.
“It’s something that makes me happy, like it’s a treat to myself,” the 24-year-old digital marketing consultant from the Philippines tells TIME of Pop Mart’s CryBaby toy—a plush genderless creature with puffy red cheeks, furrowed brows, and welled-up tears around its eyes.
Since discovering Chinese toy company Pop Mart a year ago, Carrillo has bought nearly 100 of its products, many of which she gives as gifts to friends and family. Her love for the brand has sent her on a hunt for its characters, including travelling to Singapore for just 24 hours in hopes of finding a limited edition or waiting four hours in the rain in Taiwan just to come away with one collectible.
And Carrillo isn’t alone. A search of “Pop Mart” on TikTok renders hundreds of thousands of hauls and unboxing videos. Fans have flocked overseas to look for sold out or exclusive products at different Pop Mart stores, roboshops (vending machines), or pop-ups; and groups on Facebook and WeChat trade updates on when the brand comes out with new lines or restocks its products.
That virality has translated into a recent boom for the company, which was founded by 38-year-old entrepreneur and now-billionaire Wang Ning in 2010: last year its shares shot up by almost 370%, ahead of most members on the MSCI China Index. In mainland China alone, Pop Mart has over 46 million members, consumers who sign up to collect points for purchases, as of December 2024, and even opened Pop Land, an amusement park spanning 40,000 square meters in Beijing, in September 2023.
But it’s outside China where Pop Mart is really taking off. Over 130 of the company’s more than 530 stores worldwide as well as over 190 of more than 2,490 roboshops, as of December 2024, are located outside mainland China, and its non-mainland revenue grew by 375% to 5 billion yuan (about $700 million) in 2024, accounting for nearly 40% of its approximately $1.8 billion total revenue, according to the company’s 2024 annual report, which was released on Wednesday.
Some might say Pop Mart is riding a wave. One could argue, however, that it is making the wave. While the rest of China’s economy slowed and youth unemployment spiked last year, its guzi—goods, specifically character-based merchandise and collectible toys—market continued to soar, with Pop Mart leading the way. China’s designer toy industry is projected to reach more than 110 billion yuan, or US$15 billion, in retail sales in 2026—more than 1500% increase from 2015, when retail sales were just US$890 million. Worldwide, the toy and figurine market is projected to reach a market value of $49 billion by 2034, up from $26 billion last year.
“I go Pop Mart everywhere,” Lisa, the mega famous Thai actress-singer and member of K-pop group Blackpink, told Vanity Fair in a “my secret obsession” video in November. “If I fly to New York, I go to Miami, I try to find Pop Mart there, Paris, you know, everywhere. Kind of like a treasure, finding treasure.”
Here’s what to know about how Pop Mart took over the world.
Redefining luxury for a new generation of consumer
Where Pop Mart distinguishes itself from both domestic and international competitors is in reading the mood of its consumers, Ashley Dudarenok, who runs a China and Hong Kong-based consumer research consultancy, tells TIME. Whether it’s rebelliousness, a desire to escape, or exhaustion from work or school, Pop Mart customers are buying more than just a toy, they’re buying a symbol of themselves.
They’re often essentially useless, says scholar Erica Kanesaka, an assistant professor of English at Emory University specializing in the politics of cuteness in Asian American literature, but they “add a sense of vibrancy and imagination to our mundane activities and environments.”
Relatability seems to be a big part of cultivating fandoms for different characters. Carillo says she is drawn to the CryBaby series because she thinks of herself as a cry baby. Ashley Jane Leow, a 25-year-old filmmaker in Singapore, collects figurines of Hirono, an angsty-looking boy with tousled hair, and Nyota, an introverted girl with wide eyes and short bangs, because they remind her of herself and her boyfriend. “It got so bad that I was dreaming about it at one point,” Leow tells TIME.
Pop Mart’s strengths fit into a broader client-centric marketing model several Chinese brands have begun to adopt that incorporates client psychology and storytelling. “What truly matters is how a brand makes clients feel,” luxury brand strategy expert Daniel Langer wrote in Jing Daily last August.
Creating a following for a brand typically used to rely on products being a status symbol, such as designer handbags. But the proliferation of cheaper “dupes” made easily available on Amazon, TikTok Shop, and Shein have taken some of the allure away from such products.
Increasingly, Langer observed, many of the rising Chinese luxury brands that are now excelling globally have moved away from a traditional 4P model (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) to a 4E model (Experience, Exclusivity, Engagement, and Emotion). While Pop Mart doesn’t market itself as a luxury brand, it resembles one for a new generation of consumers, and its prices range from US$5 for a small accessory to more than US$1,500 for a 30-inch figurine, while it’s even made a foray into jewellery.
Capitalizing on artist individuality—and IP
To stand out in an international market, Pop Mart is pushing art and innovation to the forefront of its public image, Eva Zhao, the head of international marketing at Pop Mart, tells TIME. By platforming its individual designers and artists hailing from around the world, the company creates a sense of individuality in its products, a far cry from the stereotypes of mass production and copycat products often applied to Chinese brands. That also means it can partner with legacy brands that would otherwise be competitors, like Disney and Sanrio, for toys of their characters in Pop Mart’s unique style and with artists in different countries whose art might have wider appeal to customers overseas, Zhao said.
Labubu, a Nordic monkey-like forest elf with a devilish grin designed by Netherlands-based artist Kasing Lung, went viral outside of China last year for being “ugly-cute”—but it isn’t Pop Mart’s most popular character in mainland China (that’s Molly, a little girl with cat-like emerald eyes and a distinct pout designed by Hong Kong-based artist Kenny Wong). Instead, Labubu is Pop Mart’s bestselling IP globally—in part fueled by Lisa, who posted an Instagram story to her more than 100 million followers last April hugging a giant Labubu plush toy and with a Labubu bag charm. In 2024, The Monsters IP (which includes Labubu) generated 3 billion yuan (US$419 million) in revenue—a year-on-year growth of 726.6% in related revenue, according to the annual report.
Pop Mart shares the biographies of its artists on its website or social media and posts background stories and additional content for characters to try to foster deeper connection with consumers. For example, Los-Angeles based artist Libby Frame who designed Pop Mart’s Peach Riot, a punky fictional three-member girl band, also creates songs for the band.
The emphasis on the artists behind each character resonates with Leow. On a visit to the Pop Mart store in Taipei, Leow was struck by the fact that an entire floor had been turned into an exhibition of the art behind one of Pop Mart’s figurines, Pucky—a stubby, chubby sprite named after Puck from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. “I was like, you know what?,” recounts Leow, “Support an artist, I see the vision, so I bought it.”
Breaking into the global ‘cute’ market
While Pop Mart sells large busts, figurines, and accessories, their toys most commonly come in a “blind box” format. Pop Mart’s blind boxes are themed by character and series, but similar to Gashapon machines in Japan (which churn out a surprise toy inside a capsule), exactly which toy you’ll get is a mystery when you buy it.
Japan has long dominated the global “cute” market, going as far back as the late nineteenth century when Japan was a major exporter of children’s toys, says Kanesaka. That was cemented by the “explosion” of kawaii (Japanese for “cute”) culture in the second half of the twentieth century—reinforced by the “Cool Japan” campaign, a deliberate effort by the Japanese government to promote Japanese popular culture overseas. Hello Kitty, Pikachu, Kirby, and many other kawaii characters are “now firmly embedded in the global culture,” says Kanesaka, the Emory professor.
Dreams Inc., a Japanese company, makes blind box Sonny Angels and Smiskis, which are also incredibly popular worldwide, with sales last year three to four times higher than in 2022. But Kanesaka doesn’t find it unusual that a Chinese company can also now break into that market. Online shopping and social media have “opened up the flow of information about [Chinese] goods and about the racialized logics that attach China to counterfeits and second-rate products that are merely derivative,” she says.
Dudarenok, the consumer research consultant, sees Pop Mart’s global success as more than just an ebbing of stigma against Chinese manufacturing; instead it’s a direct result of the company’s ability to navigate and succeed in the Chinese market. “It’s not a surprise that this kind of company comes out of China,” says Dudarenok. That’s because “China is the world’s most competitive digital market, with maybe the most spoiled consumer in the world that wants things fast, cheap, and good.” Pop Mart understands those consumer needs, according to Dudarenok, and the Chinese domestic market lets companies “fail fast and succeed fast” to figure out what consumers really want.
One way Pop Mart distinguishes itself from Japanese competitors is through its stores. By contrast, Dreams Inc. largely sells its toys online or through distributors like Kiddy Land, Kinokuniya, and Urban Outfitters. Pop Mart, on the other hand, turns its own stores into an experience—with each modeled after one of its characters—fuelling customers like Carillo and Leow to plan travels around visiting different Pop Mart stores. They’ve also capitalized on the blind box craze through their roboshops vending machines that make buying their blind boxes all the more accessible.
For some, the model has actually generated interest in visiting China—just to visit the various Pop Mart stores and attractions there. After visiting Pop Mart stores in London, Tokyo, Singapore, and Melbourne, Samantha Todd, a 30-year-old content creator from North Brisbane, Australia, now has her sights set on the global flagship store in Shanghai, which spans more than 500 square meters with two floors and 10 rooms designed to look like a futuristic spaceship. It’s a trip she never thought of making before discovering Pop Mart.
How blind boxes foster community—and virality
Todd is one person who has found social media fame through unboxing her blind box toys. Todd discovered Pop Mart last year after posting a TikTok about how she didn’t get the allure of Sonny Angels. Her followers suggested she look at Pop Mart instead, and she “just fell in love.” Todd has since amassed dozens of Pop Mart toys—many of whom accompany her on her overseas travels in a large brown knapsack—and nearly 250,000 followers who watch her unbox her toys and visit stores in search of limited editions.
One video posted in January this year chronicles her weeklong quest to get a specific Labubu from a Pop Mart vending machine, even skipping her gym classes to be first in line. It raked in more than two million views and 200,000 likes. “Choosing labubu over gym is totally something I would do too,” one commenter wrote. “Don't know what a labubu is Or a pop mart Or the strength it requires to go to the gym more than once a year. But I'm invested,” another wrote. Other commenters said they couldn’t wait to see her unbox the toys, or they wished there was a Pop Mart near them, while others still said the video had inspired them to begin their own “Labubu journey.”
The blind box format lends itself to unboxing videos in large part because creators and viewers share in the feeling of rooting for a certain item and reacting to what they find—unlike other social media shopping haul videos, the creator doesn’t know what they’re getting, making the unboxing a kind of game or gamble as much as it is showing viewers the product, and potentially spurring viewers to buy their own and take a chance on getting the character they want. And the elements of surprise and collecting inherent to blind box toys “provide a small way to introduce magic into the ordinary and to find community through sharing, trading, and displaying them with other people,” particularly at a time when many might feel disconnected or alienated by hyper-digitalization, says Kanesaka.
That’s exactly what draws 26-year-old Amanda Lee, who works in digital marketing in Singapore, to Pop Mart. When Pop Mart started trending in Singapore last year, where the company has 10 stores, Lee and her colleagues decided to open CryBaby Powerpuff Girls blind boxes together in the middle of the workday. Since then, they’ve made it a frequent lunchtime habit, typically all buying blind boxes from the same character line and occasionally bringing back blind boxes from one of their trips overseas to open together.
“It’s just a fun little thing that we get to do together during our lunch breaks to relieve some stress,” she tells TIME. On her desk sits a CryBaby called “Starboy,” which has a turquoise ombré head capped with a matching party hat, a translucent blue body with mini baubles inside and a star on its chest, and glittery tears welling up in its eyes.
Because of the element of mystery, the blind boxes have a similar allure to gambling, so much so that China regulates sales of blind boxes to children. But there’s no risk, like gambling, says Dudarenok. You’re guaranteed to get something cute for a relatively affordable price, she tells TIME: “It’s happiness in a box.”

- The Monsters toy line, which Labubu is part of, made up 23% of PopMart's sales last year.
- Pop Mart's revenue grew 107% in 2024, and its profits more than doubled from the year before.
Labubu, the doll with serrated teeth that has Asia in a chokehold, made its producer a lot of money in 2024.
On Wednesday, the Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for selling collectible ""blind boxes"" of mystery toys and figurines, reported annual sales growth of 107% in 2024 compared with the year before.
It made 13.04 billion yuan, or $1.8 billion, in revenue, and its profits rose 204% from the previous year.
The Monsters toy line, which Labubu is part of, was particularly lucrative for the company. Its sales totaled 3.04 billion yuan, or 23% of Pop Mart's total revenue.
""THE MONSTERS has rapidly gained global popularity and earned widespread fan support worldwide, achieving a significant year-on-year growth of 726.6% in related revenue,"" the company said in its earnings report.
Pop Mart, which is publicly listed in Hong Kong, saw its stock price rise about 11% to 141 Hong Kong dollars, or $18, when markets closed Wednesday. It's up almost 400% compared with a year ago.
The Labubu retail phenomenon
Retail analysts speaking with Business Insider in November attributed Labubu's popularity to several factors, including celebrity endorsement.
In April, Lisa, one of the four singers from the hit K-pop band Blackpink, posted a Labubu on her Instagram, which set off the craze for the product.
""I think the raging popularity of Labubu lies in its unique designs, emotional connection, exclusivity, and association with Lisa,"" Sory Park, a project manager at the Chinese consumer research firm Daxue Consulting, told BI.
Products in the Monsters collection in the US range from $9 for a 2-inch badge to $180 for its 23-inch plush toy.
The toymaker's footprint is largely concentrated in China — it had 401 physical stores and 2,190 ""roboshops,"" or vending machines, in China at the end of 2024. Internationally, it had 130 outlets, with new shops opening in Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US.

In the AMS Cloud segment, the total volume of supply chain assets processed reached RMB 75 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 16%.
In the FI Cloud segment, the total volume of supply chain assets processed by the ABS Cloud in 2024 soared against the market headwind, reaching RMB 54.2 billion, with a 101% year-on-year surge. This remarkable growth was accompanied by notable achievements in product innovations, such as successfully facilitating the issuance of the first Technology Intellectual Property Asset-Backed Note (ABN) in China and assisting Shenzhen Energy Group in issuing the first green asset-backed securities in the Greater Bay Area. In the eChain Cloud segment, the company proactively reduced some low-margin businesses and launched the lightweight one-stop AI Agent for supply chain finance, named ""BeeLink AI"", to address the digital transformation needs of financial institutions. The company has formed deep partnership with 18 customers, including Standard Chartered Bank, aiding financial institutions in enhancing operational efficiency.
In 2024, Linklogis strengthened its strategic positioning in core industries such as construction/infrastructure, power equipment, transportation, commerce and retail, successfully achieving business expansion. Linkloigs' Supply Chain Finance Technology Solutions serve a wide range of anchor enterprises in various sectors and cover all 31 industries listed in the SWS Industry Classification, among which 14 industries contributed more than RMB 5 billion in supply chain asset transactions in 2024.

AI Empowering Business Innovation, Driving Intelligent Transformation in the Industry
As a dedicated player in the field of artificial intelligence within China's supply chain finance technology sector, Linklogis consistently invested into AI technology research and development, as well as application scenarios. This year, based on the LDP-GPT technology, the company innovatively launched the industry's first lightweight one-stop AI Agent for supply chain finance, named ""BeeLink AI"".

By deepening technical collaboration with DeepSeek large language models, Linklogis aims to further enhance its cognitive engine capabilities, targeting full-process automation in customer management, risk control, and other areas, while significantly reducing operational costs.
In terms of product and scenario innovation, Linklogis has actively accelerated the innovation practice of the ""de-anchored"" business models for supply chain finance. The company continued to implement data-driven product solutions without clear debtor acknowledgment for comprehensive platform customers, promoting gradual optimization of product portfolios and a steady improvement in revenue quality. During the year, Linklogis partnered with 18 central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and leading private corporations, including Universal Medical Group, Jiangsu Transportation Holding Group, Yangtze River Industrial Investment Group, Shanghai Urban Construction Group, and Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group, to implement integrated industry-finance platform projects, further solidifying its leading market position. Additionally, the company is optimizing cross-border cloud services through AI technology. In the overseas market, Linklogis has built full-link logistic financing solutions for logistics service providers of several renowned cross-border e-commerce platforms, significantly improving the efficiency of capital turnover in cross-border trade.
Strategic Acquisitions Expanding Market Reach, Accelerating Global Layout of International Business
Linklogis is unlocking new avenues for growth through strategic acquisitions and globalization strategy. In 2024, the company expanded its business scope and product line by acquiring Shenzhen Bytter Technology Co., Ltd. This transaction will further enrich the company's product matrix, extending from supply chain financing solutions for upstream and downstream partners of anchor enterprises to group-level capital management solutions. This acquisition will enable Linklogis to provide comprehensive services for upgrading intelligent treasury management platforms, covering from treasury management to supply chain financial system development for central state-owned enterprises (SOEs), large private corporations, and institutional customers, empowering customers to accelerate the establishment of world-class financial management systems.
In the international business segment, the total volume of supply chain assets processed by the Cross-Border Cloud in 2024 reached RMB 20.7 billion, representing a 64% year-over-year growth. Leveraging the dual-engine strategy of ""Go Early"" and ""Go Deep"", Linklogis remains committed to expanding a broad and diverse global partner network, providing cross-border trade financing services for small and medium-sized merchants and helping leading Chinese outbound enterprises expand their global supply chain industry-finance systems. Linklogis announced plans to establish regional operational centers with localized teams in the United States, United Kingdom, and India. These centers will form an integrated operational network with the company's Asia-Pacific resources at the Singapore international business headquarters, Olea's industrial ecosystem network in Southeast Asia, and Green Link Digital Bank's cross-border settlement capabilities. This development marks Linklogis' advancement into a deeper phase of globalization strategy, comprehensively building a globalized business framework.

Pop Mart,Unbox. Post. Repeat. The Labubu Lifestyle - Forbes,2025-03-24 07:00:00,"How a furry elf with “ugly-cute” charm became a billion-dollar icon in the toy world—and beyond.
In an era where digital avatars dominate and virtual goods fetch eye-watering prices, one of the most surprising consumer success stories of the past few years has been decidedly physical, pint-sized, and, at first glance, slightly, well, peculiar.
Meet Labubu—a wide-eyed, snaggle-toothed creature from the imagination of artist Kasing Lung, brought to life by Chinese toy powerhouse POP MART. Once a niche art figure inspired by Nordic folklore, Labubu is now a global lifestyle phenomenon, embraced by millions, from teenage collectors to A-list celebrities.
But this is more than just a story of a cute character. The meteoric rise of Labubu signals a major shift in consumer behaviour—one that blends nostalgia, mystery, digital virality, and identity-driven collecting.
The Story Behind the Smile (and Teeth!)
Labubu began life as part of The Monsters series, a collaboration between Hong Kong-based illustrator Kasing Lung and POP MART. Designed with rough edges, exaggerated expressions, and an almost unsettling cuteness, Labubu didn’t follow the rules of traditional toy design—and that’s exactly what made it stand out.
POP MART’S genius lay not just in licensing the character but in how it was marketed: through blind boxes—sealed packaging that hides which version of a toy is inside. For collectors, it’s a constant gamble. For POP MART, it’s a masterstroke.
This “mystery model” taps into something deeply psychological: the thrill of surprise, the drive to complete a set, the social cachet of uncovering a rare edition. And when that’s combined with hyper-curated aesthetics and limited-edition drops, you don’t just have a toy—you have a cultural currency.
When Viral Meets Vinyl
Much like Beanie Babies and Pokémon in decades past, Labubu’s rise is as much about community as it is about the character. But unlike those 90s icons, Labubu’s following has been fuelled by algorithms and influencers.
On Xiaohongshu, TikTok, and Instagram, unboxing videos rack up millions of views. Fans painstakingly catalogue their collections, trade duplicates, and share creative DIY modifications. A single mystery box becomes a social experience, a talking point, a digital badge of identity.
Add in celebrity endorsements—from Rihanna to BLACKPINK’s Lisa—and Labubu transcends toy status. It becomes fashion, fandom, and lifestyle all at once.
The Business of Belonging
Behind the viral videos and pop culture cachet lies a formidable business machine. POP MART, founded in 2010, has turned the art toy niche into a multi-billion-dollar global industry. Its IPO in 2020 was met with explosive investor interest, and the brand has since expanded into retail stores, vending machines, and licensed partnerships across the world.
The Labubu range now includes everything from plush toys and enamel pins to lifestyle accessories and apparel. In many ways, it mirrors the rise of Hello Kitty or Disney’s Stitch—characters that go beyond their origins to become global brand ecosystems.
But what truly sets POP MART apart is its ability to make scarcity scalable. Limited-edition Labubu figures are flipped on resale platforms for multiples of their original price, making them part toy, part investment. Labubu limited editions are currently listed on the eBay marketplace in excess of $5000. The “thrill of the hunt” becomes a resale business model.
A Collector’s Market—But Also a Cultural Movement
The most telling sign of Labubu’s rise isn’t in the financials—it’s in the emotional connection fans express. Collecting Labubu is not just about possession; it’s about identity, creativity, and connection.
Among Gen Z and millennial consumers—many of whom grew up in a world of screen-based interactions—Labubu offers something tactile and emotionally resonant. There’s a mindfulness in the collecting, a sense of play that isn’t mediated through pixels.
And crucially, there’s community. Online fan groups, in-person trading events, and customised fan art reinforce the idea that this is more than a product—it’s a shared experience.
Lessons in Retail, Reinvention, and Relevance
So what can brands learn from the Labubu craze?
- Emotion Sells: Characters that connect emotionally—even if they defy traditional beauty standards—can carve powerful brand loyalty.
- Mystery Drives Engagement: The blind box model proves that gamification, when done thoughtfully, can drive repeat purchases and social sharing.
- Social Media is the Storefront: In a world where TikTok and Xiaohongshu shape trends, product design and marketing must be intrinsically “shareable”.
- Nostalgia and Novelty Can Coexist: Labubu blends old-school toy collecting with contemporary design cues and digital behaviours. That fusion is key.
- IP is King: As Pop Mart expands its character universe, it demonstrates the enormous potential of IP—not just in content, but in product and experience.
From Counterculture to Countertop
Labubu’s success story is still unfolding. With Pop Mart continuing its international retail expansion, new collaborations on the horizon, and ever-growing fanbases in the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia, the character’s future is bright—and furry.
More than just another viral trend, Labubu represents something deeper: a desire for play, surprise, and connection in a world that can often feel automated and impersonal.
In the age of artificial intelligence and digital fatigue, a funny-faced elf from a blind box might just be the most human product of all.","[{'head': 'POP MART', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'created_character', 'tail': 'Labubu'}, {'head': 'POP MART', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'founder', 'tail': 'Kasing Lung'}]","['pop mart', 'diy', 'instagram', 'blackpink’s lisa', 'labubu lifestyle - forbes', 'labubu', 'kasing lung', 'relevance', 'labubu’s', 'hello kitty', 'beanie babies', 'meet labubu', 'disney’s stitch', 'xiaohongshu', 'the business of belonging\nbehind', 'pokémon', 'ebay', 'among gen z', 'tiktok', 'ipo', 'ip']","- Labubu, created by artist Kasing Lung and toy company POP MART, has transformed from a niche art figure to a billion-dollar global lifestyle phenomenon, appealing to diverse demographics.

Pop Mart fanatics and collectors!
Beijing's Chaoyang Park has launched POP LAND, a 40,000 sq m dreamland dedicated to the art toy universe you adore.
POP LAND offers an immersive experience of the Pop Mart universe, filled with beloved characters like Molly, Labubu, Dimoo, and more.
Don't expect POP LAND to feature roller coasters and pirate ships on the scale of Universal Studios and Disneyland, though. Rather than an amusement park filled with thrilling rides, this POP MART-themed theme park draws inspiration from Japan's Ghibli Museum and Shiroi Koibito Park.
The park is divided into three main areas: Pop Street, Labubu Adventure Forest, and Molly's Castle
Welcoming you at the theme park's entrance is the colourful Pop Street, which features plenty of interactive activities and games. Every now and then, you might spot a meet-and-greet session with your favourite characters.
Walk past Pop Street and you'll find the Labubu Adventure Forest, home to 19 life-sized Labubus, alongside their monstrously cute companions
Explore their lore-infused habitats: a quirky fishing village, a whimsical treehouse, and the Village of Warriors.
A huge adventure playground — complete with trampolines, swings, and mazes — will be a magnet for the little ones and your inner child.
Finally, Molly's Castle takes you through three levels featuring experiential gaming installations, family-friendly attractions, and themed restaurants
And the main attraction? An exclusive POP LAND merchandise store, where you can snag limited-edition collectibles to commemorate your visit.
POP LAND is open every day from 10am to 8pm, with the last admission at 7pm
Here are the ticket prices:
Adults
Weekdays: 150 yuan (approximately RM92)

Pop Mart,"POP MART, an IP company: the many collabs of the blind box maker - Dao Insights",2025-03-21 07:00:00,"Key takeaways:
- Chinese toymaker POP MART has been shifting its image from a “blind box” maker to an IP-centric brand, while aggressively expanding overseas.
- It has launched several fashion collaborations since March, as well as its latest campaign with fellow IP-licensor Disney.
- It is also using offline events at Harrods and Dover Street Market, with limited collaboration figurines/bag charms to enter the luxury fashion world.
Chinese toymaker POP MART has been taking the world by storm with its hit IP, LABUBU. Commentators have long discussed how POP MART is moving beyond its image as just a “blind box” toymaker and positioning itself as an IP-centric brand through frequent collaborations. These collaborations include licensing its IPs and using others’ IPs for its products, but it remains primarily focused on its “blind box” figurines.
They’re in fashion
It’s not the first time that POP MART has done fashion collaborations. From the Valentino MOLLY figurine collab to LABUBU’s stint at Milan Fashion Week, the brand’s past collabs are mostly publicity-centric and limited in number. Since the beginning of March, POP MART has already announced two more accessible co-branded collections with two of its popular IPs.
On 3 March, POP MART launched its collab collection with Shanghai-based fashion brand D’zzit. As part of both brands’ campaigns ahead of International Women’s Day (IWD), the collection features Nyota, one of POP MART’s IPs and actress Ai Mi as the model to show a “slower” lifestyle for women in the form of “slow fashion” provided by D’zzit. The launch also includes a “literary prize” on Rednote, which calls for writing on the theme of “slow emotions”.
On 8 March, POP MART and British fashion brand BOY London announced that they are partnering up for a collection featuring POP MART’s PINO JELLY. It aims to break down the barrier “between dimensions” (as cartoon characters are often called “2-dimensional” or “二次元erciyuan”) and combines the “soft and cutesy” PINO JELLY with the rebellious punk spirit of BOY LONDON, and its iconic yet somewhat controversial eagle insignia. BOY London also brought in its frequent partner, Chinese singer and actor Adam Fan Chengcheng as the face of the collection.
First we take London
Apart from co-branding with fashion brands, POP MART is also conquering the luxury fashion world on the ground. On 10 March, a three-way collaboration was announced between Perfect Magazine, Dover Street Market (DSM) and the Zimomo IP, fellow MONSTER of LABUBU, for an exclusive and limited-to-100-piece figurine, leveraging the recent bag charm boom.
The launch is followed by the 14 March opening of an eight-week pop-up space at London’s prestigious Harrods department store. People queued outside Harrods for a chance to meet Kasing Lung (龍家昇), the creator of the MONSTERS, including LABUBU and ZIMOMO. Lung hosted a signing at the DSM the next day for the ZIMOMO figurine as well.
S-DIMOO-boat Willie
Earlier this year, the founder and CEO of POP MART, Wang Ning, announced that the company no longer aims to be the “Disney of China”. In fact, POP MART has been licensing Disney IPs quite regularly for its blind box products, and Disney can be seen as a regular part of the IP-centric toymaker’s roster. Late last year, POP MART officially opened its Disney Village shop in France.
In mid-March, POP MART announced its latest collab, this time between Disney and its DIMOO IP. The collection features DIMOO dressed up as Disney characters, most notably Mickey Mouse, including the Steamboat Willie characterisation mentioned in the subheading above. The promotional campaign is equally eye-catching with two pop-ups, one in Shenzhen and the other at Disneytown in Shanghai. There will also be a new “DIMOO World Disney” theme for the “ROBO SHOP” vending machines across China.
With other bold moves such as a Hirono concept store in Shanghai and a Hirono collab with Hong Kong-based street fashion brand CLOT, as well as a The Little Prince-themed exhibition at the Louvre, also with the Hirono IP, POP MART is quickly expanding the influence of its IPs.
The frequent licensing and collaboration reminds one of another IP leviathan: Sanrio
Many pundits feel that POP MART IPs lack the stories behind them as Disney characters do. But the frequent licensing and collaboration reminds one of another IP leviathan: Sanrio. Although Hello Kitty and Kuromi appear in a variety of animated shorts and shows, the characters always seem to be more focused on the mascot than their stories. However, POP MART is trying to be “the POP MART of the world”, so of course, it will be exploring its own strategies for that. But with the global LABUBU boom, it is only natural for the company to take a leaf out of the Sanrio book and try to establish the fuzzy MONSTER in the pop culture canon.

MooMoo,Moomoo vs. Robinhood: What’s the Best Commission-Free Trading Platform? - FinanceBuzz,2025-03-21 07:00:00,"The days of needing a lot of money and access to a financial advisor to start investing are long gone. Instead, investing is as easy as downloading an app and getting started.

When to go with Moomoo
Moomoo, a subsidiary of Futu Holdings, is a stock trading app that offers access to stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and options. Moomoo and Robinhood share several great features, but there are a few things that make Moomoo stand out.
Here are a few situations where Moomoo might be the right choice for you:
- You want a stock analysis tool
- You want access to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
- You want to practice investing
Powerful stock analysis
The Moomoo app has an array of free advanced trading tools and analysis resources. Robinhood offers several tools, but you'll have to subscribe to Robinhood Gold for $5 to get access.
One of Moomoo's tools is options analysis, which can be helpful when you're trying to determine a strategy. Another tool is the insights it offers, which may help you execute more effective options strategies if that's what you're interested in.
On top of that, Moomoo compares prices on assets across exchanges so you can get the best price. There's also an advanced stock screener to help you identify ideas for your next investment. Moomoo also has access to updated real-time quotes through the Arcabook, which is used by the NYSE.
For intermediate to advanced traders who want access to more tools and insight and a more advanced platform, Moomoo might be the better choice since it offers these tools for free.
Access to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
In addition to U.S. stocks, Moomoo also allows you to participate in the Hong Kong stock market. Moomoo offers access to almost 3,000 Hong Kong stocks, a feature you can't get with Robinhood.
Learn the ropes with paper trading
If you want to practice a new investing strategy without risking your money, you can do so with Moomoo's paper trading. Paper trading is basically fake investing. The platform gives you $1 million of virtual money, and you can practice trading stocks, options, and futures.
Moomoo has a library of educational resources, including more than 900 courses to help you learn the ropes. You can put these techniques to the test with paper trading and feel more confident when you're ready to start trading for real.

When to go with Robinhood
Like Moomoo, Robinhood offers commission-free trading on stocks, ETFs, and options. It's one of the most popular trading apps on the market, and for good reason. Let's talk about a few reasons you might prefer Robinhood over Moomoo:
- You want to invest in cryptocurrency
- You want to invest for retirement
- You want to place pre-IPO orders
- You want a cash back credit card
Cryptocurrency investing
Robinhood offers exposure to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. If you're interested in trading crypto, Robinhood could be a good choice.
Robinhood doesn't charge any fees or commissions for cryptocurrencies, so it can be cheaper than using an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini. On the other hand, the available cryptos are much more limited with Robinhood.
Moomoo doesn't offer the ability to trade cryptocurrencies, but you can get access to cryptocurrency news and follow the prices and latest trends.
Investing for retirement
In addition to taxable brokerage accounts, Robinhood also offers both traditional and Roth IRAs.4 <p>The IRA Match is automatically added after eligible contributions from an external account. Keep the contributions in your IRA for at least 5 years from the date you contribute.

You can think of this boost the same way you would an employer match on your 401(k). However, you'll have to leave your money invested for at least five years to keep the match.
Pre-IPO orders
If you're interested in placing pre-IPO orders, Robinhood offers that as a trading choice. You aren't technically buying pre-IPO shares, but you're able to enter your order before the IPO goes live. Then, once trading begins, Robinhood will execute your trade.
However, it's important to note that Robinhood won't guarantee your order will be filled. These are limit orders, so you might not get an execution on your order. On top of that, Robinhood doesn't offer pre-IPO orders on all stocks that go public.
If you're interested in IPO investing, learn how to buy IPO stocks before you get started.
Cash back credit card
In addition to its trading features, Robinhood also offers the Robinhood Gold Card, which is a cash back credit card available to Robinhood Gold subscribers. With this card, you'll earn 3% cash back on all categories and 5% cash back on travel booked through the Robinhood travel portal.
Other card perks include:
- $0 annual fee
- No foreign transaction fees
- Trip interruption protection
- Purchase protection
- Auto rental collision damage waiver
- Extended warranty protection
- Return protection
- Travel and emergency assistance
- Roadside dispatch
You can redeem your cash back for statement credits, deposits into your Robinhood brokerage account, travel points, shopping points, and gift cards.

What both investment platforms excel at
Moomoo and Robinhood have more similarities than differences, which means either option could be a good fit for most investors. Here are a few things both platforms do very well:
- Commission-free trading: Both Moomoo and Robinhood offer commission-free trading for stocks, ETFs, and options. Additionally, both platforms make trading and investing accessible to many people. Although Moomoo might be better suited for those at the intermediate and advanced levels, even beginners can use the app with relative ease. Robinhood is more suited to beginning investors, but more advanced traders can use the app to accomplish their goals.
- Fractional shares: Both Moomoo and Robinhood offer fractional shares, which means you can buy just a portion of a share instead of an entire one. For example, if a stock trades at $100 per share, you could buy just a quarter of a share for $25. This makes stocks more accessible for investors who may not be able to buy full shares.
- Margin trading: Both Moomoo and Robinhood offer margin trading, which is essentially when you borrow money from your broker to increase your investment. Then, you'll pay back the broker with your investment earnings. Margin trading is risky and isn't right for every investor, but both Moomoo and Robinhood offer this option.
- After-hours trading: The normal stock trading day ends at 4 p.m. ET, but both Moomoo and Robinhood have extended trading hours until 8 p.m. ET. Your trade won't technically execute while the market is closed. Instead, the order will be queued for the beginning of the next trading day. Keep in mind that pricing is based on the last trade price of the day, and there's no guarantee that's the price your order will execute at.
- High-yield cash sweeps: Of course, you can earn money by investing in the market, but both Moomoo and Robinhood allow you to make money on your uninvested dollars. Moomoo allows you to earn 4.10% (as of 12/18/24) APY on your uninvested cash, while Robinhood allows Gold members to earn 4.00% (as of 12/27/24) APY. Keep in mind that these rates are subject to change, and they likely will as interest rates go down.
- Investor protection: With both Moomoo and Robinhood, you're getting access to a broker that is registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Additionally, both platforms carry Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC) insurance, protecting your account in the event the online broker goes out of business. It's important to note, however, that SIPC insurance won't protect you from market events or losses in stock value.
Which investment platform should you choose?
When deciding on an investment platform, it's important to consider what's important to you. Some factors to consider when choosing between Moomoo and Robinhood include:
- Available asset classes
- Fees
- Features you're looking for
Generally, it's a good idea to consider the types of assets you're likely to trade and how often you expect to trade. If you know you're going to trade options frequently, it might make more sense to choose Robinhood because you could avoid the contract fee that Moomoo charges. Additionally, if you want access to cryptocurrencies, Robinhood could be a better choice.
Also, keep in mind that Robinhood Retirement accounts give you access to the tax advantages of both traditional and Roth IRAs. On the other hand, Moomoo doesn't offer any type of retirement savings account.
On the other hand, if you're a trader who is intermediate to advanced and you want access to more tools and analysis, Moomoo could be the better choice. Moomoo offers analysis tools for options trading and a stock screener that's effective for those with a little more experience. If you want features that go beyond what Robinhood offers, Moomoo could be a good option.

先正达集团,Syngenta and PepsiCo reward farmers for regenerative farming practices - bastillepost.com,2025-03-20 07:00:00,"BASEL, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar 20, 2025--
Syngenta, leader in technology and innovation in agriculture, and PepsiCo, global leader in food and beverages, are working in collaboration with the aim of boosting regenerative and traceable agriculture in the food industry value chain in a transparent and verifiable way.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320349801/en/
During the first year of joint work, Syngenta provided PepsiCo with 4,000 tons of sunflower oil from fields of farmers in the province of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, San Luis and Santa Fe, who applied regenerative agriculture practices.
In a second stage, it is expected to increase the hectares that implement these practices by at least 25%. Through Syngenta's Sustainable Sourcing Program, farmers can trace the good practices carried out on their fields like crop rotation, cover crops, irrigation efficiency, use of biological products and pollinator habitat development, among others with constant support and monitoring from Syngenta, and obtain an additional value per ton, which is granted by the verification of these practices. The process includes third-party validation, ensuring security throughout the entire commercial chain.
The commercialization of sunflower grain is carried out through Syngenta's AVC (Agriculture Value Chain) program, which facilitates the exchange and export of oil.
The traceability of field practices is executed through Syngenta's Cropwise digital platform, with which farmers can measure and verify their regenerative practices and implement continuous improvement plans, to ensure compliance of these practices.
“At Syngenta, sustainability is embedded in the business. Regenerating soil and nature through practices that aim to leave the system better than we found it, is a commitment we assume every day,” comments Mariale Álvarez, Head Sustainability & Corporate Affairs LATAM at Syngenta . “This time, together with a strategic partner like PepsiCo, with whom we share this same vision, we are taking this commitment one step further: farmers who join our Sustainable Sourcing Program receive an economic benefit by demonstrating the adoption of regenerative farming practices in their production process, which has a positive impact not only on the environment but also on their profitability” she explains.
“Companies have a great responsibility to care for and improve the way we produce food. At PepsiCo, everything we do is driven by sustainability at its core, within the framework of pep+, our global transformation strategy that aims to create and inspire positive change on the planet and in people,” comments Santiago Desmery, Oils Category Leader, PepsiCo Southern Cone and Brazil.
“With this project, PepsiCo Southern Cone becomes the company's first region at LATAM level to have 100% regenerative agriculture in the sunflower it uses,” adds Desmery.

Pop Mart,"Pop Mart, Haidilao, Nongfu Spring to set tone for China consumption - Yahoo News Singapore",2025-03-20 07:00:00,"Pop Mart, Haidilao, Nongfu Spring to set tone for China consumption
Expectations are particularly high for Pop Mart International Group's earnings, whose blind box toys have become a global phenomenon amid celebrity fanfare and strong overseas sales.
Chinese consumer giants dominate next week’s earnings after a survey showed consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic and Beijing outlined plans to revive consumption by boosting incomes.
Earnings reports are seen as potential catalysts after details from a closely watched consumption-focused press conference earlier underwhelmed investors.
Expectations are particularly high for Pop Mart International Group, whose blind box toys have become a global phenomenon amid celebrity fanfare and strong overseas sales. Midea Group stands to benefit from China’s consumer trade-in measures. Haidilao International Holding and Nongfu Spring are also due.
Meanwhile, efforts to to support an economic recovery by issuing 500 billion yuan ($92.09 billion) in special sovereign bonds to boost capital at its biggest banks puts the outlook of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China in focus.
Chinese banks held their benchmark lending rates for a fifth straight month in the absence of more monetary easing.
Highlights to look out for
Monday: BYD’s full-year revenue likely surged 27%, consensus shows. The carmaker’s recently revealed lineups of EVs which can charge nearly as fast as the time it takes to refuel a regular car is a “game changer,” Bloomberg Intelligence said. More affordable models could emerge soon in a boost for sales.
Tuesday: Haidilao International’s second-half revenue will likely be weighed down by lower contributions from its restaurant operations, consensus shows. The company’s table turnover rate is expected to be under pressure in the second half, due to a high base a year earlier and a sluggish catering market, CGS International said. Overall, its full-year revenue growth likely slowed to about 8%.
Nongfu Spring is likely to post the slowest annual profit growth since its listing amid the price war in China’s bottled water market. Still, BI expects earnings should be steady in the medium term as Chinese consumer preferences shift toward health-conscious options. Analysts at Citi also expect it will benefit from the country’s pro-consumption measures.
Kuaishou Technology’s fourth-quarter revenue likely rose 9.7%, supported by growth at its online marketing services unit. Its online digital advertising business will likely face pressure from its rivals including Douyin and Xiaohongshu, BI said.
Wednesday: Pop Mart’s full-year earnings are expected to more than double on higher revenue contributions from its retail stores and online channels. Citi reckons that the company’s growing global footprint and recognition of its diverse character figurines should continue to underpin its solid growth momentum.
Bank of China may face net interest margin challenges amid lower rates in both domestic and overseas markets, said BI.
Thursday: No major earnings of note.
Friday: Midea should report 11% second-half profit growth as it continued to benefit from China’s home appliance trade-in program. Analysts also cheered better-than-expected retail sales growth for the first two months of the year, seen as positive for companies like Midea in 2025.
Country Garden continued to see sales slump amid its restructuring efforts. The developer is seeking to postpone payments for two domestic bonds that were due in March, according to local media outlet The Paper.
ICBC, CCB and AgBank could see earnings miss consensus amid a bigger-than-expected margin squeeze, BI said, noting a mandatory 50 basis points cut in rates on outstanding mortgages and lower reinvestment bond yields.
CCB and AgBank are seen worst off.

Sirio notes that according to Innova Market Insights, launches featuring high-strength claims rose by 69% in Europe and 150% in 2024 worldwide compared to the previous year.
Additionally, the global gummy market grew 70% between 2020 and 2025 and is currently valued at an estimated $1.7 billion.
As a rapidly expanding solution for delivering high-strength ingredients, gummies appeal to consumers because of their convenience.
However, historically, manufacturers have faced challenges with processing methods and struggled to address taste and texture concerns when including increased levels of active ingredients.
Formulating gummies must take into consideration heat and liquid limitations due to the medium in which the active ingredients are being placed.
The nutraceuticals must be stable, and the flavor must appeal to consumers without too much reliance on sugar as brands are moving towards healthier, low-sugar and plant-based formulas.
Lowering the doses of the active ingredients may improve the flavor, but it usually means consumers need to take multiple daily gummies.
“XtraGummies is the culmination of extraordinary work by our 330-strong R&D team—a figure unmatched by any other nutraceutical CDMO—and commitment to technical progress and constant innovation,” Lesina said.
The new range
The new range includes six trending gummy concepts.
Xtra Omega-3 is a high-strength fish oil providing 125 mg of essential docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per gummy. Xtra Creatine provides 1,800 mg per gummy for recovery support. Xtra Iron has triple ingredient action to enable maximum absorption and contains 14 mg of iron in a two-gummy dose.
Magnesium citrate, biotin and selenium constitute the remaining three supplements in the range, which all have a shelf-life of 24 months and are quality assured to European Standards.
The high-strength products expand Sirio’s portfolio of gummies, including vitamins and minerals, omega-3s and probiotics, all offering vegan options.","[{'head': 'Sirio', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'general_manager', 'tail': 'Sara Lesina'}]","['innova market insights', 'omega-3s', 'xtragummies', 'gummy', 'lesina', 'xtra', 'dha', 'xtra iron', 'xtra creatine', 'sara lesina', 'sirio europe & americas', 'sirio']","- Sirio launched a new range of high-strength gummies due to growing consumer demand for convenient supplement delivery formats.

Read the Tiger Account review on Mozo for more information about the platform.
Tiger Brokers’ Tiger Trade app is quite feature-rich for a mobile share trading platform. As a result, the comparatively busy nature of the interface may not be to everyone’s taste. However, the home page is highly customisable, so you can have as much or as little as you like on it.
Aside from its customisability, the Tiger Trade app also has a social aspect where users can discuss stocks and market movements with the wider Tiger Brokers community. This communal aspect can be useful for beginners, as you can ask questions and find out what other share traders are saying about certain stocks.
Perhaps the most useful feature of the Tiger Trade mobile platform is the US$100,000 demo account. It’s not real money, so you won’t actually lose your hard-earned cash or gain anything from successful trades (except maybe some tangible experience).
Tiger Trade share trading app features

This means that you won’t have to jump over to Twitter/X to talk about share trading – in fact, eToro has investors from over 140 countries so you can trade and discuss. You can also follow top performing traders and copy their trades if you’re not sure where to begin.
Plus, eToro has this neat feature called Smart Portfolios where you can invest in ready made portfolios. You’ll get to choose from a range of themes including ESG (environmental, social, governance), tech, utilities, real estate, and even a Warren Buffet style portfolio.

5. Mobile share trading app for minimalists
Stake brings a very sleek and minimalistic look to its mobile share trading platform. The screen doesn’t feel busy, allowing you to focus on what’s there. But don’t be fooled by its simplicity. There are still plenty of features that put ease of use first.
However, those that want access to even more detailed information, charts, and data might not be as satisfied with the Stake app.
That being said, Stake recently launched a web platform to complement its mobile offering, which includes charting, portfolio management, and stock research tools.
Stake mobile app features
- See a real-time countdown to when the market closes
- Switch between ASX and Wall St stocks at the tap of a button

6. Mobile share trading app for experienced investors
The CommSec Mobile share trading app gives you a comprehensive range of tools for managing your stocks and portfolio in real-time, accessing price history charts and detailed stock information, live market data and news, and custom watchlists with alerts.
They’ve managed to pack a lot into the app for such a small screen size. Beginner investors may feel a steeper learning curve due to how much information is on the screen at once. Conversely, experienced traders may view that as a bonus.
Stay informed with market news and videos from the CommSec media team, see the latest market movers, and view dividend and market announcements all within the CommSec Mobile app.
A key feature that may tide Apple fans over is the ability to view and receive live alerts on share prices through the Apple Watch.
Note: The App Store (iOS) version of the app has far more positive reviews than the Play Store (Android) version of the app. So, this mobile share trading platform may be better suited to Apple iPhone and iPad users.

- Place trades on the go with your iPhone or iPad
- Custom watchlists
- Receive alerts for watchlisted stocks
- Access live market and share price data

7. Mobile share trading app with a focus on passive investing
Pearler says its share trading platform is catered more towards long-term investors that want to build their wealth over time. With the addition of auto-investing plans (so you can set and forget your investments or take advantage of dollar-cost averaging), the app also has the ability to help you track custom financial goals.
There is also a communal aspect to the Pearler mobile share trading platform, where you can follow ‘finfluencers’ for inspiration on your way to financial independence.
Pearler share trading app features
- Invest in shares, LICs and ETFs
- Choose a template portfolio to invest in, or pick your own stocks

While these share trading apps are great, make sure you also consider the fees associated with trading. It’s not always about what’s on the surface. So, making sure the actual platform is right for your needs is paramount.

The store opened with a unique signing event with Kasing Lung, the creator of the beloved ‘THE MONSTERS’ series, who made his first-ever appearance in Europe.
The pop-up opened on Friday March 14th in Harrods’ Kids Toy Section on the fourth floor and will run for six weeks. It showcases an array of POP MART’s most popular IPs, fan favourites across ‘THE MONSTERS’ series, along with exclusive products and hot releases. This curated space is truly a dream for toy collectors and Labubu fans.
Labubu, a character that has captured the hearts of many, has been spotted with celebrities and fans such as Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Rina, and Lisa from Blackpink. With its rising popularity, the pop-up is expected to attract long lines and eager fans.
Kasing Lung, the visionary behind Labubu, was also in attendance for a two hour signing event at the Harrods pop-up on Friday. Lung created the Monsters series, drawing inspiration from Nordic folklore and mythology, which he cherished in his childhood. The series features characters like Zimomo, Tycoco, Spooky, Pato, and Labubu—who quickly became a must-have accessory for fashion-forward collectors in 2024.
“We are thrilled to expand POP MART’s presence in the UK with this exciting pop-up at Harrods. The brand’s connection with our consumers makes Harrods the perfect venue for our signing event.”

Pop Mart,Labubu Fans Form Long Line Outside Harrods for Creator Kasing Lung - WWD,2025-03-16 07:00:00,"LABUBU FEVER: Harrods is now selling Labubu, one of the hottest collectible toy-cum-bag charms in the world of fashion, following the opening Friday of an eight-week Pop Mart pop-up.
Diehard fans of the fluffy figurine with a grin of spikey teeth formed a long queue outside the store before opening hours, hoping to purchase rare Labubu models and meet their creator, Kasing Lung.
They came wearing designer bags accessorized with Labubu toys, dressed in stylish miniature outfits. Some even brought giant-size plush models to meet Lung.
After meeting fans in the pop-up, Lung came up to the newly opened, appointment-only Harrods penthouse to interact with celebrities, including Olivia Attwood and stylist Harry Lambert.

On Saturday, Lung hosted another signing with Perfect Magazine at Dover Street Market London.
Some 100 customers who won the raffle for a limited-edition Labubu black-and-pink figurine also formed a long line outside the retailer. They brought their own Labubu collections for him to sign. Some even brought their pets dressed in Labubu-appropriate attire to meet Lung.
In fashion, the fluffy figurine, part of the China-based toymaker Pop Mart’s The Monsters collection, is riding on the burgeoning bag charm trend and counts a string of pop stars like Lisa, Rihanna and Dua Lipa, and even Thai royals, as fans.
The Monsters range, created by Lung, includes Labubu, first designed in 2015, as well as other characters: Zimomo, Spooky, Tycoco and Pato. Leung signed a licensing agreement with Pop Mart in 2019.
Just like most of Pop Mart’s popular toy ranges, the mischievous-looking Labubu is being sold as a plush toy, a mega-sized collectible, and in a blind box, meaning the customer receives a random product from a themed series. It often includes standard styles that are revealed on the packaging and hidden styles that are highly regarded among collectors.
The Harrods pop-up will be Pop Mart’s seventh branch in London. For eight weeks, the store will be stocked with exclusive Labubu collectibles, special gifts and hot products. Those who purchase a blind box item during the opening period will be able to enter a raffle for a chance to purchase a limited edition, U.K., exclusive Zimomo figurine.
As part of the artist’s European trip, Lung will also attend meet-and-greets in Paris and Amsterdam in the coming days.","[{'head': 'Pop Mart', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'creator', 'tail': 'Kasing Lung'}]","['pop mart', 'monsters', 'lung', 'kasing lung - wwd', 'perfect magazine', 'spooky', 'labubu', 'kasing lung', 'zimomo', 'leung', 'rihanna', 'lisa', 'olivia attwood', 'dua lipa', 'tycoco', 'labubu fans form long line outside harrods', 'harrods', '’s european', 'pato', 'pop mart’s', 'harry lambert']","- Harrods opened an eight-week Pop Mart pop-up featuring the collectible toy Labubu, attracting long queues of fans upon launch.

MooMoo,"Nvidia trading on Tiger, Moomoo, FSMOne explodes after DeepSeek beating opens buying opportunity - The Business Times",2025-03-14 07:00:00,"Nvidia trading on Tiger, Moomoo, FSMOne explodes after DeepSeek beating opens buying opportunity
Tiger Brokers reports 300% jump in Nvidia shareholders on its platform; brokerages see continued volatility-driven surge
[SINGAPORE] When China artificial intelligence (AI) player DeepSeek burst onto the global scene in January, it rocked the AI world and wiped hundreds of billions off Nvidia’s market value.
But Singapore investors were quick to jump in and buy the dip, leading to huge surges in activity on trading platforms such as Tiger Brokers, Moomoo and FSMOne.
DeepSeek hogged the headlines when it surged to the top of Apple Store’s download charts in late January. It was touted as an alternative to and able to perform on a par or even outperform OpenAI and Meta’s models. But the bigger shock to the AI market – hitherto dominated by Open AI’s ChatGPT – was that DeepSeek cost a fraction to build, and consumes less power. This led to a sell-off in Nvidia, whose top-end chips drive ChatGPT.
Tiger Brokers said that this year, the number of Nvidia shareholders on its Singapore platform surged a whopping 293 per cent in the one year to Mar 4, and the amount of Nvidia shares owned rose 123 per cent in the same period.

On Moomoo, the average trading volume for Nvidia jumped 75 per cent, and average trading value grew 47 per cent between Jan 27 and Feb 26, compared with the immediate preceding one month.
Over at FSMOne Singapore, research analyst Joel Phua said: “We observed that Nvidia was highly traded from late January 2025 to late February 2025. Investors continued to buy the dip when Nvidia’s stock crashed significantly from the US$130+ to the US$110+ range.”
FSMOne said that Nvidia, leading electric vehicle maker Tesla and Big Data software firm Palantir are the three most traded stocks on its platform.
Plenty of concerns
After the sell-off in January, Nvidia shares plummeted again in February even though its February earnings report topped analysts’ expectations.
James Ooi, market strategist at Tiger Brokers, said that investors turned negative as earnings delivered only a modest beat, with concerns over deteriorating profit margins and slowing earnings growth.
Like most US stocks, the counter is currently buffeted by the global trade tariff turmoil and recession fears. In the past two weeks, it has retreated over 10 per cent, and more than 16 per cent year to date.
Is it still yet another opportunity to buy the dip? Or will other factors cloud the outlook?
DeepSeek’s success could actually boost Nvidia’s graphics processing unit demand despite Nvidia being among the hardest hit, Tiger Brokers said.
FSMOne’s Phua agrees: “Investors remain bullish on Nvidia, believing that the success of DeepSeek will encourage and accelerate the adoption of AI by more companies, thereby increasing demand for semiconductor chips, which will benefit Nvidia and other industry players.”
Tiger Brokers’ Ooi said: “If DeepSeek triggers a Jevons paradox – where lower computing costs drive even greater demand for compute (power) – or if, as Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang predicts, next-generation AI consumes 100 times more compute, we could see Nvidia’s revenue growth reaccelerate.”
In addition to fundamentals such as a compelling AI narrative, charismatic CEO and consistent earnings outperformance, Nvidia’s price volatility offers investors and punters opportunities to arbitrage.
Trade tariffs
One big unknown is the global trade tariff war being played out.
Ooi said US President Donald Trump’s 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could raise the cost of Nvidia’s AI servers assembled in Mexico, while further potential US trade restrictions on Nvidia’s chip exports to China might also influence sales.
But Brian Colello, equity strategist at Morningstar, highlighted that TSMC’s announcement of US$100 billion in new spending in the US in the years ahead could reduce the likelihood of heavily punitive tariffs being implemented.
He added: “Certainly, Nvidia will face ongoing restrictions and legislation on what it can sell into China, and perhaps other countries that might not crack down on any potential Chinese smuggling. But this is separate from tariffs.”
Morningstar maintained its fair value estimate for Nvidia at US$130. Nvidia shares were trading at about US$115 as at Thursday’s (Mar 13) close.
Morgan Stanley was bullish enough to raise its price target for Nvidia on Feb 27 – from US$152 to US$162. It said that AI spending is not a “bubble”, with Nvidia going through a “remarkable growth phase”.
However, Moomoo’s chief market strategist Isaac Lim said that while “Nvidia is not directly affected by the tariffs, there would be some challenges faced from the supply chain angle” as it currently has some parts and systems made in Mexico.
“With the tariffs of 25 per cent levied on Mexican imports, this would definitely impact the costs of related products,” he explained. “At the same time, with TSMC now committing US$100 billion to expand into the US, Nvidia will be able to produce chips locally at the new US-based facilities, and that could help offset any long-term tariff-related increase in costs.”
Lim expects Nvidia to trade within a tight range of US$113 to US$125.
Beyond Nvidia, Singaporeans continue to favour trading in US stocks instead of local listcos.
“The more astute Singaporean investors are looking to the broader US market for opportunities to own a piece of other undervalued US stocks,” he said.

泡泡玛特,Cape Town’s art toy scene is booming. Here’s where to shop - Cape Town ETC,2025-03-12 07:00:00,"Young adults are spending their hard-earned cash on toys, and who’s to stop them? This trend toward childlike wonder has slowly made its way into Cape Town and here is where to shop.
Legacy toy brands are also rebooting and reprising themselves, releasing toys that young people of today would have owned or wanted to own when they were children. This nostalgia factor is definitely a leading factor in the recent toy-buying craze. Being able to relive one’s childhood and revive that childlike wonder poses as a reprieve from the hustle, bustle and work-related stresses of adult duties.
Some toy brands are even catering straight to adults. Brands like Sonny Angel and PopMart are producing ranges of art toys and blind boxes that seemingly bring out the child in young adults with ease.
Art toys are designed and created by artists and are meant to be collected and displayed rather than played with. Young adults have risen to the occasion, collecting entire lines and releases and displaying them in cases. Bedrooms are turning into toy museums of sorts, because once you have one, you have to complete the set.
Blind boxes are also highly popular among young adults. These toys are enclosed in boxes and the buyer will not know which toy variant they are getting until they open said box. This mystery adds to the fun, with people online trying to guess which variant they might get before opening their blind box.
Blind boxes usually overlap with art toys. PopMart exclusively sells art toy blind boxes and has a wide range of series and lines for people to choose from. Series featuring sweet characters and IPs allow for anybody and everybody to find one that they resonate with.
IPs like Labubu – a cute, fluffy monster with a vinyl face – have become endlessly popular within fashion communities as of late and several young Cape Town locals have been spotted sporting the character as a bag charm or accessory.
Adding plush charms to handbags and backpacks has become a trend within fashion communities of the young and old around Cape Town and PopMart has caught onto this trend. Currently releasing a variety of lines that double as bag charms, allowing for buyers to accessorise their bags and outfits. One of these lines being the popular Labubu.
WonderPort Collectibles
WonderPort Collectibles also has their PopMart game on point.
With a large catalogue of PopMart blindbox toys to choose from, every customer will leave with their cart full and their inner child happy.
Cape Venison & Biltong
Cape Venison & Biltong has recently started stocking these art toys along with other imported goods and sweet treats. The store carries a wide range of IPs, some of which have already sold out, but do not fret, as they have already stated that a restock is imminent.
- Location: 12 Suikerbos St, Blomtuin, Bellville, Cape Town

- Contact: 064 678 5493
- Online: @cvbblomtuin | facebook.com/cvbblomtuin
Retailers selling art toys are exploding in popularity and are receiving a good amount of support around Cape Town. There are even trade communities being set up for blind box figures; should someone unbox a toy they already own – as is the way of the blind box.
With such a wide range of toys to choose from, work stress and commitments, and hard-earned income, it is no wonder then that young adults are tending towards spoiling themselves like a kid again.

Moomoo offers free stock and option trades in an easy-to-use trading platform that charges low margin rates. It's not built for passive retirement investors — IRAs aren't supported, nor are mutual funds — but there's a lot to like about Moomoo for more active traders.

How do we review brokers?
NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks the largest U.S. brokers by assets under management, along with emerging industry players. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgments on which ones will best meet your needs. Our highest priority is maintaining editorial integrity.
We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).
For more details about the categories considered when rating brokers and our process, read our full methodology.
Where Moomoo shines
Free equity options trades: Moomoo is one of the few brokers that charges neither a commission nor a per-contract fee on equity options trades. Index options have a $0.50 per-contract fee, but even that's on the lower end among brokers we review.
Streamlined mobile app: Moomoo has clearly put a lot of effort into its mobile experience. Signup is a breeze, and the trading interface is intuitive, without skimping on features that will appeal to advanced traders.
Where Moomoo falls short
No mutual funds or individual bonds: Moomoo offers ETFs, including bond ETFs, but if you want specific mutual funds or individual bonds in your portfolio, you'll have to look elsewhere.
No IRAs or retirement planning tools: Moomoo isn't really made for retirement-oriented investors. The broker does not offer IRAs (only taxable brokerage accounts), nor does it have any built-in retirement planning tools such as calculators.
Alternatives to consider:
For mutual funds and bonds: Charles Schwab, Firstrade
For retirement planning: Fidelity, Merrill Edge
What type of investor should choose Moomooo?
Options traders: Moomoo's free options contracts on stocks, and very-low-cost options contract fee on indexes, make it one of the cheapest brokers we review in terms of options trading costs.
Margin traders: Most brokers we review offer tiered margin rates based on account balance or account type — but Moomoo offers a flat rate of 6.8% to all users. That will appeal to margin traders — especially those with smaller accounts, which may not have a sufficient balance to earn comparably low rates elsewhere.
International investors: Moomoo is a multinational broker, and offers its services to investors in several countries.
What the Nerds think 🤓
""Moomoo has one of the smoothest account signup processes of any broker we review. You can simply download the app and let it walk you through an account application, one question at a time — and then seamlessly link a bank account through Plaid.
There's a lot to like about the trading experience as well, especially for advanced traders. Moomoo gives you a richly featured trading interface that includes charts, various statistics and a variety of order types and options. The only downside is that this volume of information might feel slightly overwhelming for beginner investors. The app is protected by a passcode system for quick and secure logins, which is a plus.""

How to sign up for a Moomoo account
We tested out Moomoo's signup process through its mobile app, which walks you through the account application process, one question at a time. It's one of the smoothest signup experiences among brokers we review. You'll need to provide them with some basic information, such as your Social Security number. Once you've completed the application and funded your account, you'll be ready to trade.
Moomoo says that it offers instant buying power — that is, users can trade as soon as they initiate a deposit, without waiting for funds to settle — but this may not apply to the initial deposit upon opening an account. We had to wait a couple of days for funds to settle before we started trading.
What to know about Moomoo's fees
Moomoo has no account minimum, annual fee or inactivity fee. It charges a fee of $75 for partial or full outbound ACAT transfers (i.e., transferring investments from Moomoo to another broker), which is a fairly standard fee among brokers we review.
U.S. stocks (both exchange-listed and over-the-counter) are completely free to trade on Moomoo, as are equity options. Index options have a $0.50 per-contract fee, and American Depositary Receipts (i.e., foreign stocks) have a commission of $0.01 to $0.05 per share.
Moomoo charges $10 for broker-assisted trades. That's less than what many other brokers we review charge for a phone call with a human broker, although a few brokers offer this service for free.
Moomoo's trading platforms and apps
Moomoo's mobile app combines a sleek, easy-to-use interface with lots of features that will appeal to advanced traders, including charts, statistics and a variety of different order types. It's popular on the app stores; both the iOS and Android versions have average star ratings of more than 4.5. That's fairly rare among the stock apps we review.
How we nerd out testing trading platforms
Our reviewers — who are writers and editors on NerdWallet’s content team — test every online broker platform in our analysis hands-on. That way, we can report on every aspect of the user experience, from funding a new account to placing trades.
We score each broker against criteria that factor in the capabilities offered and the actual user experience of trading with those capabilities. This includes how easy it was to sign up for and fund a new account. Note that a broker may score very highly for the platforms it offers but low for the experience of actually using that platform. Our analysis scores these criteria separately and weighs them evenly when factored into the broker’s overall score. As a result, a broker can offer an advanced trading platform. Still, if it is clunky to use or the process of opening an account is unnecessarily arduous, their score will reflect that.
Moomoo also offers a web trading platform via a TradingView integration, and a desktop platform, plus APIs. These all give investors access to markets during Moomoo's extended trading hours, which run from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday.
One standout feature about Moomoo's trading platform is its flat margin interest rate of 6.8%. There are a few other brokers we review that offer comparably-low margin rates, but most have a tiered margin system in which you need a hefty account balance to get single-digit rates. Moomoo charges the same rate to all users.
What do investors say about their experience with Moomoo?
NerdWallet's evaluations focus on data we collect, like account fees, portfolio diversification, features and account minimums, as well as our own experiences with the products we review. We include two factors that directly address customer service: Support availability and contact methods, and website transparency, which our team assesses by looking for key information on the provider's website, just as a potential customer would. But customer satisfaction is harder for us to directly assess. To offer a more complete evaluation, we've used an AI tool to comb Moomoo reviews for iOS and Android. We then evaluate that data for consistent themes, both positive and negative. Due to the anonymous nature, we're unable to confirm these customer experiences as we normally would. The summary below is based on up to a year's worth of Moomoo reviews, ending Feb. 2025.
Moomoo's app reviews are generally very positive on both iOS and Android — roughly three-quarters of reviewers give a five-star rating, which is a high share of positive feedback compared with the ratings we've analyzed for other mobile apps. Customers consistently praise the educational resources, as well as the data and analysis tools, confirming that Moomoo is a good fit for both beginner and more advanced traders. Customers even report good experiences with the customer service, and mentions of technical glitches are rare.
Negative themes center around long deposit and withdrawal times, as well as an interface that can be a bit overwhelming at first, particularly for new investors.
Moomoo's investment selection
Moomoo offers access to U.S. stocks (including exchange-listed stocks, OTC stocks and IPOs), foreign stocks, ETFs and options. Mutual funds aren't available, nor are individual bonds, although Moomoo users can still diversify into fixed-income securities via bond ETFs.
Users can buy fractional shares of select stocks and ETFs, subject to a $5 minimum. Some brokers don't offer fractional shares at all, but Moomoo is at a disadvantage to several other brokers that offer fractional share trading on all stocks, with no minimums.
Other key Moomoo features
Research and data
Investors get access to NYSE and Nasdaq Level II market data through Moomoo, as well as news and research from Bloomberg, Morningstar and other providers.
Customer support
Moomoo offers 24/7 chat and email support, as well as phone support from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday. It also has a large bank of educational articles, videos, courses and tutorials, and a fairly easy-to-navigate website.
Cash management
As of this writing, investors who opt in can earn a yield of over 4% per year on up to $1 million in uninvested cash at Moomoo, which is on the higher end among brokers we review. A current promotion pays new users an extra 3.5% per year on up to $20,000 in uninvested cash — a total yield of 8.1% on that amount — for three months.
Good to know about Moomoo
Execution quality
Moomoo says that 95.58% of its orders are executed at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) price or better. That's lower than the average execution quality among brokers we review. Moomoo itself does not accept payment for order flow (PFOF), but Moomoo says that its clearing broker, Futu Clearing, which is owned by the same company as Moomoo, ""may receive payment for order flow or rebates.""
Payment for order flow is an arrangement in which brokers route customer orders through trading firms for execution, in exchange for payment. The trading firms then use the customer order data to inform their own trading decisions. For most investors, the effects of PFOF are negligible, but PFOF may result in slightly slower executions or worse prices than you'd get at a non-PFOF broker. This may be a significant disadvantage for high-volume day traders.
Nerdy Tip
The average execution quality of all brokers we review was 96.95% as of Oct. 16, 2024. That means 96.95% of orders sold for at a price that was at or better than the National Best Bid and Offer. Executing at or above the NBBO means you may receive a price improvement or a better share price than you were originally quoted.
Is Moomoo safe?
All investing comes with a risk of loss, but Moomoo carries Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance that protects up to $500,000 per account (up to $250,000 in cash) in the event of broker insolvency.
Moomoo is also regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Is Moomoo right for you?
Moomoo isn't a retirement-oriented broker. But if you're not looking for IRAs, mutual funds, bonds or planning tools, it offers one of the smoothest app experiences of any broker we review, low (often zero) options trading costs, and low margin rates for all. If you're in search of a mobile platform to up your trading game, Moomoo may be exactly what you're looking for.",[],"['terms & conditions', 'api', 'tipranks', 'benzinga', 'mt newswire', 'american depositary receipts', 'the financial industry regulatory authority', 'nyse', 'etf', 'moomoo', 'dow jones', 'nbbo', 'securities investor protection corporation', 'pros & cons\ncommission-free stock', 'acat', 'morningstar', 'nasdaq level ii', 'the national best bid', 'futu clearing', 'the securities and exchange commission', 'android', 'offer', 'nerdwallet', 'sipc', 'social security', 'nerds', 'fidelity', 'charles schwab', 'merrill edge', 'inc.', 'pros']","- Moomoo provides commission-free trading for stocks, ETFs, and equity options, with no account minimum or annual fees, but lacks IRA and mutual fund support.

Pop Mart,POP MART Unveils THE MONSTERS × One Piece Series Figures - stupidDOPE,2025-03-11 07:00:00,"Table of Contents Show
POP MART is expanding its lineup of sought-after collectibles with an exciting new collaboration—the THE MONSTERS × One Piece Series Figures. This highly anticipated release blends the whimsical artistry of THE MONSTERS with the legendary characters of One Piece, bringing fans a fresh and imaginative take on the iconic Straw Hat Pirates.
With LABUBU and THE MONSTERS already taking the collectible scene by storm, this crossover promises to be a must-have for both One Piece enthusiasts and designer toy collectors alike. Featuring meticulously crafted figures, a mystery unboxing experience, and a nod to the treasure-filled world of the Grand Line, this series is set to make waves in the global market.
A Unique Collaboration Between Two Creative Universes
POP MART’s THE MONSTERS is an original IP that introduces playful, mischievous elves from various forest tribes. Among them, LABUBU has risen to international fame, with collectors scrambling to get their hands on the latest releases. Now, the enchanting designs of THE MONSTERS meet the world of One Piece, bringing a fresh interpretation to beloved characters.
This collaboration reimagines Monkey D. Luffy, Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Nami, Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Brook, and Trafalgar D. Water Law, among others, in THE MONSTERS’ signature aesthetic. Each figure retains the essence of its One Piece counterpart, while incorporating the whimsical proportions and playful charm that define THE MONSTERS.
A Collectible Experience Full of Surprises
As with previous POP MART releases, the THE MONSTERS × One Piece Series follows a mystery box format, meaning each unboxing is an adventure in itself. Fans won’t know which figure they’ll receive until they open the package, making the hunt for their favorite characters all the more thrilling.
Each figure stands proudly atop a metallic Belly coin-inspired base, featuring a luminous finish that pays tribute to the treasure-filled world of One Piece. The attention to detail, high-quality sculpting, and intricate paintwork ensure that every piece is a standout addition to any collection.
A Global Phenomenon in the Making
With POP MART stores across the U.S. consistently selling out of new releases within hours, the demand for THE MONSTERS collectibles is at an all-time high. Add One Piece’s massive worldwide following, and it’s easy to see why this collection is expected to disappear from shelves just as quickly as it arrives.
Collectors and fans of both franchises should keep a close eye on POP MART’s official website and select retailers to secure their figures before they sell out. Given the history of rapid sellouts with LABUBU and other POP MART collaborations, this series is likely to be one of the brand’s most in-demand drops to date.
Where to Get the THE MONSTERS × One Piece Series
The THE MONSTERS × One Piece Series Figures will be available through POP MART’s online store, official retail locations, and select global stockists. Release dates and pricing details are expected to be announced soon, so fans should stay tuned for updates.
With its blend of artistic reinterpretation, mystery box excitement, and One Piece nostalgia, this collection is shaping up to be a highlight of the year for toy and anime enthusiasts alike.","[{'head': 'POP MART', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'majority_ownership', 'tail': 'THE MONSTERS'}, {'head': 'POP MART', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'majority_ownership', 'tail': 'LABUBU'}]","['labubu', 'belly', 'straw hat pirates', 'pop mart unveils', 'monsters', 'brook', 'piece', 'monkey d. luffy', 'pop mart', 'trafalgar d. water law', 'pop mart’s', 'the the monsters × one piece series', 'nico robin', 'roronoa zoro', 'tony tony chopper', 'ip']","- POP MART is launching a new collectible series called THE MONSTERS × One Piece, combining characters from One Piece with THE MONSTERS' playful designs.

Chinasoft International,Soft Power Divide: China Advances While U.S. Retreats - Foreign Policy in Focus,2025-03-11 07:00:00,"The global landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, a tectonic shift in the balance of influence. The sixth annual Global Soft Power Index, released by Brand Finance, confirms what many have observed: China has ascended to the world’s second most influential soft power nation, trailing only the United States.
This achievement, coinciding with contrasting political pronouncements from Beijing and Washington, underscores a pivotal moment in international relations. While China’s Premier Li Qiang outlines a vision of openness and engagement, U.S. president Donald Trump champions a retreat into isolationism. This divergence presents a fertile ground for China’s soft power to flourish, filling the perceived vacuum left by a receding American presence.
China’s ascent is not a sudden phenomenon; it is the culmination of a deliberate, multi-faceted strategy. Unlike the hard power dominance of military might and economic coercion, soft power relies on attraction and persuasion, on shaping perceptions and influencing preferences. China has meticulously cultivated its soft power through a diverse array of cultural, technological, and diplomatic initiatives.
At the heart of China’s soft power strategy lies its burgeoning cultural industry. Chinese films, once confined to domestic audiences, are now garnering international acclaim. Blockbusters like Ne Zha 2 and the international buzz surrounding Black Myth: Wukong demonstrate China’s growing prowess in animation and gaming, industries that resonate strongly with younger generations worldwide. The global success of Chinese dramas and historical series on streaming platforms underscores the universal appeal of compelling storytelling.
Beyond cinema and gaming, China’s digital platforms are reshaping global communication. TikTok, with its viral content and trendsetting influence, has become a cultural phenomenon, particularly among young people. Xiaohongshu, a lifestyle and e-commerce platform, is attracting a growing user base in the West, showcasing Chinese trends and consumer culture. These platforms, while raising concerns about data privacy and censorship, serve as powerful conduits for cultural exchange and soft power projection.
The promotion of the Chinese language and culture is another cornerstone of China’s soft power strategy. Confucius Institutes, despite facing scrutiny in some countries, have played a significant role in disseminating Mandarin language education and cultural awareness. Online language learning platforms and educational programs are further expanding access to Chinese language and culture, fostering a deeper understanding of China among global audiences.
China’s technological advancements are also contributing to its soft power. The country’s rapid development in areas like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and telecommunications has positioned it as a global leader in innovation. For instance, companies like DeepSeek are making significant strides in developing advanced AI models, showcasing China’s growing capabilities in cutting-edge technology. DeepSeek’s progress in areas like large language models and AI-driven applications demonstrates China’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of technological innovation, attracting international attention and respect. Huawei’s 5G infrastructure development and China’s leadership in solar panel production have resonated with nations seeking technological solutions. China’s investments in green technology and its commitment to addressing climate change have also resonated with nations seeking sustainable solutions.
Furthermore, China’s proactive diplomacy and its engagement in multilateral institutions have enhanced its international standing. Its Belt and Road Initiative, while facing criticism for the so-called debt traps, has provided infrastructure development and economic opportunities to numerous countries, particularly in the developing world. China’s contributions to peacekeeping missions and humanitarian aid efforts have further solidified its image as a responsible global actor.
The timing of China’s soft power ascent is particularly significant. As the United States appears to be retreating from its traditional role of global leadership, China is stepping forward to fill the perceived vacuum. Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, his withdrawal from international agreements, and his imposition of trade tariffs have alienated allies and created uncertainty in the international system.
This perceived decline in U.S. soft power is creating opportunities for China to expand its influence. U.S. cultural dominance, once unquestioned, is facing increasing competition from Chinese cultural products and digital platforms. The U.S. emphasis on unilateralism and its skepticism towards multilateral institutions contrast sharply with China’s rhetoric of cooperation and shared prosperity.
Moreover, domestic political divisions and social unrest in the United States, including events such as the January 6th Capitol riot and increasing political polarization, have tarnished its image as a beacon of democracy and stability. China, by contrast, presents itself as a stable and reliable partner, a nation committed to economic development and international cooperation. A key aspect of this decline is highlighted by the Trump administration’s cuts to USAID and foreign aid programs, which have historically been significant tools of U.S. soft power. This retreat from international assistance diminishes the U.S. ability to project a positive image and build relationships through development and humanitarian efforts. This inconsistency between domestic policy and international image erodes trust in the United States as a reliable partner.
However, China’s soft power ascent is not without its challenges. Criticisms from certain Western political figures and media regarding human rights, censorship, and intellectual property protection present a persistent challenge to its global image. Furthermore, while China’s cultural exports and digital platforms have achieved considerable traction among younger demographics, questions remain about their ability to cultivate deeper, enduring influence across diverse populations.
Despite these challenges, China’s soft power is undeniably growing. Its ability to leverage its cultural, technological, and diplomatic assets has positioned it as a major player in the global arena. As the United States appears to be withdrawing from its traditional role of global leadership, China is poised to fill the perceived vacuum, shaping the international landscape in its own image.",[],"['ne zha 2', 'confucius institutes', 'focus the', 'trump', 'brand finance', 'donald trump', 'ai', 'deepseek', 'huawei', 'trump’s “america first', 'li qiang', 'xiaohongshu', 'tiktok', 'usaid', 'soft power divide', 'global soft power index']","- China has become the second most influential soft power nation, according to the Global Soft Power Index, trailing only the United States.

Sirio Pharma,AI for nutra: Finding supporting evidence and refining products key opportunities - NutraIngredients-Asia.com,2025-03-10 07:00:00,"Insilico Medicine is known for using AI for new drug discovery and also works with nutraceutical companies like SRW Laboratories in developing new products.
Speaking to NutraIngredients-Asia on the sidelines of Founder Longevity Forum held in Singapore on February 27 to 28, the company talked about common queries from nutraceutical companies when it comes to the use of AI.
One, companies would like to find supporting evidence on how their nutraceutical products work.
This can help them better explain the way their products work to consumers.
“There is a growing interest for nutraceutical companies to use AI to find evidence to support the rationale of their existing products.
“Traditionally, we relied on literature findings to back up claims and understand how certain ingredients work.
“Now, with advanced AI models, we can better interpret and analyse the vast amount of available scientific data,” Frank Pun, Head of Insilico Hong Kong, Insilico Medicine, told us.
However, before finding the supporting evidence, the task is to first identify the active ingredients used in the nutraceuticals at the molecular level.
This also presents a challenge as active ingredients such as botanical extracts are complex mixtures of molecules.
However, once the molecule is identified, AI can be used to find out how the genes the molecule interacts with and influences.
“I think the primary challenge for nutraceuticals lies in identifying active ingredients at the molecular level. Once we characterise these specific molecules, we can then determine which genes they interact with and influence,” he explained.
Following which, companies will still need to conduct further studies, such as cell line studies, animal studies, or proceed to human clinical trials to validate the scientific evidence found using AI.
Some companies may also want to refine their existing formulations after getting to know how their products work.
“It really depends on the company’s goals. For many companies, the primary purpose is to explain how their current products work, followed by identifying better formulations and combinations.
“Compared to pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals historically lacked strong scientific validation.
“Therefore, companies are now using AI to find more comprehensive evidence supporting their products' health claims,” he said.
For Insilico Medicine, one of the company’s latest research showed that a particular medication for dry eye can potentially address endometriosis.
The medication, known as Lifitegrast, is a prescription eye drop used to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
By using AI, the company found out that Lifitegrast targets a specific gene - integrin subunit beta 2 (ITGB2) - by inhibiting its gene expression.
This particular gene is also upregulated in human endometriotic specimens. Therefore, inhibiting the gene expression may potentially address endometriosis.
The company then went on to validate the potential benefits of Lifitegrast for endometriosis by conducting a mice study.
The findings, published in Advanced Science last December, Lifitegrast has effectively suppressed lesion growth. This shows that the dry eye medication could potentially be repurposed for endometriosis treatment.
“Using a similar approach, if we can identify the active ingredients within nutraceutical products at the molecular level, then we can find their therapeutic gene targets and conduct comprehensive pathway analyses, similar to pharmaceutical drug repurposing strategies,” said Pun.
Pun also presented the above research findings when presenting on the topic “AI for Drug Discovery” during the second day of the forum.
Hallmarks of Ageing research
Insilico Medicine is also aiming to find out the genes that play a role in the hallmarks of ageing.
Twelve hallmarks of ageing have been proposed by scientists so far, including chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence. The idea is that ageing can be slowed down by targeting these hallmarks.
Insilico Medicine is aiming to find out the genes that affect these hallmarks of ageing, as well as active ingredients at the molecular level that influence these genes.
For example, if a gene is involved in the cell senescence pathway, it could either be that the gene is pro or anti-cellular senescence - working in either of these two directions.
Once the gene target is identified, companies can then design a molecule that tackle this particular gene.","[{'head': 'Insilico Medicine', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'Head of Insilico Hong Kong', 'tail': 'Frank Pun'}, {'head': 'Insilico Medicine', 'relation': 'invested_in', 'subtype': 'partnership', 'tail': 'SRW Laboratories'}]","['pun', 'ai', 'advanced science', 'founder longevity forum', 'lifitegrast', 'frank pun', 'srw laboratories', 'insilico medicine']","- Insilico Medicine utilizes AI for drug discovery and collaborates with nutraceutical companies to support product claims with scientific evidence.

MooMoo,Grim news for home-owners as finance guru reveals why Aussies should forget about another rate cut - Daily Mail,2025-03-09 08:00:00,"Grim news for home-owners as finance guru reveals why Aussies should forget about another rate cut
- Moomoo talking down prospect of another rate cut
Australians have been told to forget about any more interest rate cuts in 2025, with the end of electricity rebates next month predicted to send inflation soaring.
While headline inflation is now back within the Reserve Bank's two to three per cent target, the federal government's $300 electricity rebates end on April 1 with the last quarterly payment of $75 for power providers to pass on.
Moomoo market strategist Jessica Amir said the return to full-price power bills will fuel inflation in late 2025, and rule out any hope of further rate cuts this year.
'The thinking is now we're probably not going to get any more rate cuts in Australia. That is a concern,' she told Daily Mail Australia.
'Power bills in Australia are still at record levels - if you take out the rebate, they're going to keep on climbing.'
The Reserve Bank last month issued new forecasts showing inflation, now at 2.4 per cent, soaring to 3.7 per cent in late 2025 following the end of the power rebate plan.
Ms Amir said it was still too early to declare the cost-of-living crisis to be over, even though inflation has fallen to a three-year low for now.
'We do know with inflation being cripplingly high, there's still no answers,' she said.

Soaring mortgage and rental payments has seen more Australians use buy now, pay later apps for groceries, via the purchase of gift cards from Coles and Woolworths.
'That means that more people are continuing to use buy now, pay later companies because they're increasingly being used as a budgeting tool,' Ms Amir said.
The Reserve Bank cut interest rates in February for the first time since November 2020.
But the minutes of that meeting suggested the 25 basis point cut, taking the cash rate to 4.1 per cent, could possibly be the last in this cycle.
'They emphasised that the decision at this meeting acknowledged the progress that had been made in reducing inflation while not committing the board to ease policy further,' the minutes said.
Ms Amir said the RBA minutes highlighted the further rate cuts were becoming less likely.
'There's still not really a 100 per cent chance, there's not even a 90 per cent chance, not even an 80 per cent chance, of an RBA rate cut,' she said.
The Reserve Bank's deputy governor Andrew Hauser last week cautioned Australians against expecting a series of interest rate cuts in 2025.
Moomoo market strategist Jessica Amir said this was likely to see inflation soar again in late 2025, and stop further rate cuts this year
'The rate cut in February reduces the risks of inflation undershooting that midpoint, but the board does not currently share the market’s confidence that a sequence of further cuts will be required,' he said.
He also suggested the RBA was focused on keeping inflation low, which could potentially reduce the likelihood of more rate cuts.
'It does have one key job – and that is to ensure that, of all the things people do have to worry about, inflation is not one,' Mr Hauser said.
'High inflation hurts everyone. It hits living standards, particularly for those on low and fixed incomes. And it disrupts households and companies' plans.'
Commonwealth Bank and Westpac are still expecting three more rate cuts in 2025 to take the RBA cash rate back to 3.35 per cent for the first time since March 2023.
But the futures market is now less certain about rate cuts, pricing in just two more rate cuts this year.
The RBA is expected to leave rates when it makes its next decision on April 1, and would be likely to wait until its May meeting, following the release of March quarter inflation data.
The Reserve Bank has even left open the possibility of raising interest rates again should inflation rise.
'If data signalled inflation was proving more persistent than expected, it would be reasonable to... hold the cash rate at 4.1 per cent for an extended period - or by even tightening policy if the outlook was for inflation to rise,' it said in the February minutes.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers may extend the electricity rebates in the March 25 Budget.","[{'head': 'Moomoo', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'market_strategist', 'tail': 'Jessica Amir'}, {'head': 'Reserve Bank', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'deputy governor', 'tail': 'Andrew Hauser'}]","['rba', 'andrew hauser', 'jessica amir', 'hauser', 'daily mail', 'aussies', 'commonwealth bank', 'the reserve bank', ""the reserve bank's"", 'treasurer jim chalmers', 'coles and woolworths', 'ms amir']","- Australians are advised to abandon hopes of further interest rate cuts in 2025 due to anticipated inflation rises following the end of government electricity rebates on April 1.

SMI Semiconductor,Predator GM9000 Gen5 2TB SSD Review – SMI SM2508 Controller Creates SSD Perfection - The SSD Review,2025-03-07 08:00:00,"It’s pretty rare that I might use the word perfection when it comes to SSDs. There is always somewhere that an SSD can be improved upon just a bit. Our report today is of an SSD that is not yet available in North America. It is the first available ‘international’ retail SSD with the newest Silicon Motion SM2508 controller and the number of people asking for release of such an SSD in North America is massive. It is the third SSD that we have reviewed with this brand new SMI 2508 Gen5 8-channel NVMe SSD controller, all three reports showing what can be done with different NAND flash memory. Introducing the Predator GM9000 Gen5 NVMe 2TB SSD.
The Predator GM9000 is licensed and manufactured by a company named BIWIN Storage Technology and, although many aren’t so familiar with BIWIN in North America, they have been around for quite some time, since 2010 in fact. Industry experts know BIWIN as they are the official licensee for popular brands such as Acer and HP. There is good news in this. BIWIN is expanding their consumer portfolio and has tackled Japan and the United Kingdom most recently, making their way to North America soon enough…with this Predator GM9000 SSD and a ton more of flash based products. Our first introduction with BIWIN was way back at Computex in 2012 if you might believe it. Check this old picture out!
That SSD was the BIWIN C8386 which was a SATA enterprise SSD that contained an LSI SandForce controller with a total volume of 120GB. Back to the present and the SSD on our test bench today is some 17 times higher capacity, 25 times faster, and is flat out an amazing example of how things have progressed! Another 2012 Computex shot first!
The Predator GM9000 is a PCIe 5.0 (Gen 5) x4 (4-lane) form factor 2280 (22mm wide x 80mm long) that uses the latest NVMe 2.0 SSD protocol and is available in 1,2 and 4TB capacities. Performance for this SSD is listed as 14GB/s read and 13GB/s write with up to 2000K IOPS read and 1600K IOPS write at low 4K random disk access. This drops 14GB/s read and 10.5GB/s write with 1600K read and write IOPS for the 1TB capacity. Endurance for the GM9000 starts at 800TBW (terabytes written) for the 1GB version and doubles for every capacity jump with a total of 3200TBW for the 4TB SSD.
What makes this SSD so special is it’s implementation of the SMI SM2508 controller. First off, this controller is of a TSMC 6nm process which is half the size of normal SSD controllers. This is very important as the SM2508 operates at lower temperatures and produces less heat than SSD controllers that are typically 12nm in size. This controller is capable of running at speeds as high as 3600MT/s and we saw that most recently with our Micron 4600 Gen5 SSD review that was using Micron’s latest G9 276-layer 3D NAND. Just before that, we reviewed the SMI SM2508 in an engineers sample preview report where it ran at 2400MT/s using Kioxia 162-layer BiCS6 3D TLC NAND flash memory.
The Acer Predator GM9000 is a single sided SSD that contains the SMI SM2508 8-channel NVMe SSD controller, a 2GB capacity DDR4 DRAM buffer chip and two pieces of Micron 232-layer B58R 3D TLC NAND flash memory running at 2400MT/s. It’s feature set includes Microsoft DirectStorage compatibility, ECC, SMART, APST and TRIM. Click here for a detailed GM9000 Spec sheet. There is also a ton of information available at the Predator Storage website.
Not only is a cooler SSD established through its 6nm SM2508 controller and single sided design, but also, the branding sticker is of copper foil for effective heat dissipation. Right now, Amazon UK seems to be the only place to find a price point for the Predator 9000 which is good for our UK readers but not so good for those anxiously awaiting a similarly built SSD in North America. It lists at Amazon UK for $180.36 (1TB), $309.19 (2TB) and $644.17 (4TB) and comes with a standard 5-year limited warranty.

Chinasoft International,China’s Soft Power Play: Can Fashion and Digital Influencers Reshape Its Global Image? - The Diplomat – Asia-Pacific Current Affairs Magazine,2025-03-07 08:00:00,"Li Ziqi’s return to the digital sphere after her hiatus has reignited public fascination with her tranquil depictions of rural Chinese life. As a widely followed influencer, her aestheticized storytelling has resonated both domestically and internationally, making her a prominent figure in China’s cultural soft power landscape. Building on her renewed presence, Li’s performance at the 2025 Spring Festival Gala signaled a shift – not just in her status as an influencer, but in the evolving ways China presents its cultural heritage.
At the Gala, Li donned a garment painstakingly crafted using 13 distinct “intangible cultural heritage” techniques – from Chengdu lacquer art to Yangzhou velvet flowers – bringing together diverse traditions in a single, tangible form. This combination of previously dispersed cultural elements into one visible artifact underscored a broader effort to present China’s heritage in a more cohesive format, hinting at the potential of fashion to serve as a powerful vehicle for cultural diplomacy.
The dual moments – Li Ziqi’s personal return and her public elevation at the Gala, China most widely-watched television program – offer a lens through which to consider China’s evolving approach to cultural representation. Is China experimenting with a new path for soft power by integrating fashion, digital influencers, and lifestyle branding? More critically, can such a strategy transcend its domestic and diaspora audiences to build genuine international influence?
China’s Soft Power Play: Why Fashion and Influencers?
Hanfu’s debut at the 2024 Spring Festival Gala, where celebrities wore traditional Han Chinese garments from different dynasties, might set a crucial backdrop for understanding the cultural shifts that Li Ziqi’s 2025 appearance further highlighted. That state-endorsed showcase ignited a broader trend, aligning with a decades-long grassroots Hanfu revival that had previously remained on the fringes.
While Hanfu remained present in 2025’s performances, it did not command the center stage in the same way. Hanfu’s association with Han-centric symbolism and imperial legacies has long triggered debates about its inclusivity and legitimacy as a soft power instrument. Li’s garment sidestepped politically charged debates by presenting a more neutral and inclusive cultural symbol. This shift may reflect an evolving effort to refine China’s global image – one that is less anchored in ethnic identity and more focused on a harmonized aesthetic of heritage and craftsmanship.
However, this shift has not been without tensions. Some within China’s Hanfu community criticized the reduced emphasis on Hanfu, viewing it as a sidelining of a movement that has long sought cultural legitimacy. This underscores an ongoing struggle over cultural representation: who defines Chinese tradition, and whose vision of heritage prevails in the global spotlight?
The Rise of Digital Mediation in Fashioning Soft Power
Amid these shifts, digital platforms have emerged as critical intermediaries in cultural outreach. Li’s reemergence exemplifies China’s increasing integration of digital influencers into state messaging. Her participation in the 2025 Spring Festival Gala illustrates a pattern of using popular digital figures to amplify state-curated narratives, extending even to international influencers like Evan Kail, who became known for exposing Imperial Japanese war crimes before appearing at the Gala.
What is highlighted in this transformation is the role of “living labor” in cultural production. Traditionally, Marx’s concept of living labor refers to the human creativity, time, and skill embedded in cultural goods – often exploited in capitalist systems. In the digital age, living labor is not just about the act of production but about its mediation and recontextualization.
Following her return, Li incorporated the intangible cultural heritage techniques she learned during her hiatus into her content, not only showcasing traditional craftsmanship but also amplifying the visibility of such artisans. Through her highly aestheticized videos, she translates these traditions into widely accessible, emotionally resonant digital narratives.
This process is not just individual but systemic. Local governments are also collaborating with digital influencers to amplify cultural branding efforts. For instance, the Zhejiang Hangzhou Tourism Bureau has been collaborating with lifestyle influencer Chen Xiyue, who specializes in Hanfu and traditional aesthetics, to promote Hangzhou’s image through traditional crafts and cultural storytelling. By leveraging influencers, these efforts enhance the appeal of symbolic representations, grounding them in tangible human work rather than abstract state narratives. They also move beyond mere heritage preservation, fostering broader cultural participation.
Limits to China’s Algorithmic Soft Power
Yet, embedding soft power in digital infrastructures is fraught with inherent contradictions. Expressions of intangible cultural heritage, long critiqued for commercialization, are now increasingly repackaged as trendy, aspirational products. While digital platforms like Douyin, Xiaohongshu, and Bilibili expand visibility and accessibility, algorithmic logic prioritizes highly visual, bite-sized content that distills complex traditions into easily consumable aesthetics. What begins as an organic portrayal of craftsmanship risks being reduced to surface-level symbols, stripped of deeper meaning and refashioned for mass consumption.
At the same time, the effectiveness of digital soft power hinges on user engagement. Without everyday users actively sharing, liking, and remixing content, even the most carefully curated influencer campaigns struggle to gain traction. Algorithmic curation creates feedback loops, where user interactions reinforce state-aligned narratives – sometimes unintentionally.
This dual process of algorithmic curation and user participation reveals a fundamental tension at the intersection of soft power and platform capitalism. As influencers operate within platform ecosystems and platforms operate within the country’s regulations, the line between organic engagement and state-driven influence is blurred. This ambiguity complicates how Chinese fashion soft power is perceived. Is this a genuine cultural trend, or a carefully managed projection of national branding? If the latter perception dominates, it risks reducing international engagement to mere spectacle rather than sustainable influence.
Compounding these issues are geopolitical constraints. The growing global presence of Chinese platforms like Xiaohongshu or RedNote – especially amid the U.S. TikTok ban threat – demonstrates the intersections between digital capitalism, platform governance, and national image-making. Ongoing anxieties about data privacy, ideological influence, and state control may then limit the ability of China’s fashion-driven soft power to achieve widespread international influence.
Conclusion
Li Ziqi’s journey from individual influencer to state-backed cultural ambassador encapsulates the delicate interplay of fashion, digital mediation, and cultural aesthetics in China’s evolving soft power strategy. State agendas, local government initiatives, and platform dynamics all have a role in shaping these trends.
Whether this model can extend beyond domestic and diaspora audiences will be a key test of China’s ability to wield fashion and lifestyle aesthetics as sustainable tools of global influence. Its success may depend on navigating tensions – balancing authenticity with marketability, grassroots creativity with state narratives, and digital engagement with geopolitical constraints.
Ultimately, if successful, China could redefine soft power through influencer-led diplomacy. If not, it may expose the contradictions of state-aligned, platform-mediated cultural branding – where global influence is limited not by cultural richness, but by the structures through which it is disseminated.",[],"['digital', 'evan kail', 'the zhejiang hangzhou tourism bureau', 'li', 'chen xiyue', 'bilibili', 'rednote', 'li ziqi’s', 'marx', 'imperial japanese', 'xiaohongshu', 'douyin', 'hanfu']","- Li Ziqi reemerged as a prominent digital influencer at the 2025 Spring Festival Gala, showcasing rural Chinese heritage through a garment made with 13 intangible cultural heritage techniques.

Pop Mart,"Beijing roots, Louvre spotlight: How Pop Mart is making waves worldwide - SHINE News - SHINE - BEYOND A SINGLE STORY",2025-03-07 08:00:00,"Beijing roots, Louvre spotlight: How Pop Mart is making waves worldwide
Chinese toy giant Pop Mart recently unveiled a special exhibition at the Louvre in Paris, featuring Hirono (小野), a character created by Chinese artist Lang.
This setup – launched at the end of February – underlines Pop Mart's ambition to expand its international reach.
Renowned for hit IPs like Molly and Labubu, the Beijing-based brand has become a global leader in the ""collectible blind box"" trend.
Fueled by celebrity endorsements, especially from pop icon Lisa, Pop Mart saw extraordinary success in Southeast Asia over the past year.
Its 2024 semi-annual report shows the region contributed 560 million yuan, or 41.1 percent of total overseas revenue, soaring 478.3 percent year on year and making Southeast Asia the company's fastest-growing market.
Meanwhile, the brand also made headway in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere, earning 140 million yuan and marking a year-on-year leap of 158.8 percent.
Pop Mart's founder Wang Ning identifies these areas – especially Europe and North America – as the next major engines of overseas growth.
It's a remarkable journey for a company that began as a modest sundries shop in Beijing's Zhongguancun back in 2010; today, it runs more than 100 stores across over 20 countries and regions.
Since 2023, Pop Mart's proportion of overseas sales has climbed every half-year – from 13.4 percent to 16.9 percent, then 29.7 percent, and by the end of 2024, nearly 50 percent.
The possibility that international sales might soon outstrip domestic performance has emboldened founder Wang, who now aims for 10 billion yuan in annual revenue.
Wang previously compared Pop Mart to Disney, but he has shifted his stance with increasing confidence:
""We no longer want to say we're going to become 'the Disney of China.' We hope that one day we'll be 'the Pop Mart of the world.'""
IP collaborations and star power
Over the past year, Lisa often posted photos of ""Labubu"" on social media, showing off different plush variants attached to her luxury bags, held in her arms, and even highlighting store visits – demonstrating the ""celebrity effect"" on 2024's designer toy market.
Labubu, a playful hybrid of monkey and rabbit, is the brainchild of Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung.
After granting IP rights to Pop Mart, the company used its extensive marketing channels and supply-chain expertise to introduce Labubu to the broader market.
This approach – signing artists to create new IPs, testing their popularity, and expanding successful ones – is at the core of Pop Mart's strategy.
The same formula played out in the United States.
Los Angeles illustrator Libby Frame, initially unfamiliar with Pop Mart, left her job as a movie storyboard artist to pursue freelance work.
During a long flight, she sketched three punk-inspired girls modeled on West Coast culture and dubbed them ""Peach Riot,"" referencing a 1990s Pacific Northwest music movement.
Once she uploaded the images online, they gained traction and even caught the attention of a 3D designer, who rendered them into 3D models.
Pop Mart soon recognized the potential and signed Frame, officially bringing the IP under its umbrella.
""Peach Riot absolutely captures the American punk spirit – it's in their DNA,"" explains Wen Deyi, Pop Mart's Senior Vice President and President of International Business.
Merely going viral on social platforms isn't enough, however.
Pop Mart also looks for themes that resonate with local cultures.
""The popular IPs you see are just the end result of numerous discussions,"" says Zhao Shuai, head of international marketing. ""We also gather a lot of insights from local markets.""
In Thailand, the ""Crybaby"" series by Thai artist Molly gained a loyal following. Japan shows a particular affinity for Azura, while many Koreans favor Pinojelly, which resembles a bespectacled Korean youth.
Surprisingly, Hirono (小野), created by Chinese designer Lang, has gained a devoted following across Europe and the United States, with its individualistic flair resonating strongly among global audiences.
""It really speaks to me,"" says Coco, a US college student who shared Hirono on social media.
Sporting a cap, lightly flushed cheeks, and freckles, Hirono projects a lonely yet rebellious charm that hooked Coco, who even attended the designer's signing event in Los Angeles.
Beyond refining its IPs, Pop Mart adapts in-store layouts to local tastes.
When first entering the US, the company showcased familiar Disney items up front – since Pop Mart's own characters weren't widely known – then introduced its new lines and original IP.
Store location choices stem from thorough market research.
For example, in the US, Pop Mart decided to start on the West Coast, which is known for its sizeable Asian community and vibrant subcultures.
By December 2024, after nearly three years in the US, Pop Mart had about 20 stores there – 15 percent of its 130 outlets overseas and in China's Hong Kong–Macau–Taiwan, according to Jiemian News.
Looking back on the US expansion, Wen feels reassured:
""We've learned IPs don't have to compete against each other. They can grow together. Although it was tough at the beginning, the data shows progress.""
CEO Wang Ning aims to have at least 50 Pop Mart stores in the US by 2025, with new openings slated for Times Square and Fifth Avenue in New York this year.
Small steps, rapid strikes
The overseas market is more like ""100 different markets,"" says Wen, each facing unique challenges.
While the US can support large-format stores and long timelines for local IP development, Europe – with its smaller, more diverse markets – often requires a different tactic.
Pop Mart calls this strategy ""small steps, rapid strikes.""
Even so, picking the right ""small step"" is crucial.
In Europe, Pop Mart chose France as a key hub, opening eye-catching stores and taking part in cultural events.
Notably, they staged a special exhibit at the Louvre this February under the third edition of the Artistic Games.
Despite France's smaller retail profile compared to the UK or Germany, its strong artistic heritage makes it an ideal base.
Pop Mart now has five stores in France, roughly 30 percent of its total presence in Europe.
Their ""rapid strikes"" approach involves pop-up stores: short-term placements – often under six months – to test the waters before committing to permanent sites.
""If we invest heavily in a store right away and it fails, we'd be losing money for a long time,"" Wen explains.
In 2021's Christmas season, for example, Pop Mart hosted nearly 20 holiday-themed pop-ups in Australia, Japan, and South Korea, later picking the most promising neighborhoods for permanent stores.
As of now, the company runs 15 stores across Europe.
From a numbers perspective, Europe, Australia, and other markets bring in 140 million yuan (10.3 percent of overseas revenue, up 158.8 percent year on year).
Although that looks modest compared to Southeast Asia's 560 million yuan (41.1 percent overseas share, up 478.3 percent), Pop Mart deems the European push strategically essential and plans to deepen brand building there.
The company's quick-fire approach also applies globally.
Instead of fully conquering one market before moving on, Pop Mart ventured into both Asia and North America with only a short gap in between.
In 2022's second half, big stores debuted in Seoul's Hongdae and Tokyo's Shibuya, while a pop-up landed in California's South Coast Plaza around the same time.
Wang Ning says that fully saturating the US alone could take a decade, so waiting before tapping other markets isn't feasible:
""We see opportunities right now, so we must act,"" he says.
Pop Mart's 2024 semi-annual report suggests overseas revenues could hit 50 percent of the overall total – reaching 10 billion yuan and likely outpacing domestic sales.
Notably, overseas success can also benefit the Chinese market.
Wang cites cases where up to 15 percent of sales in certain domestic stores come from foreign tourists.
Next Labubu
Pop Mart's momentum depends not only on more global stores but also on discovering new hit IPs like Labubu.
IP creation is what makes Pop Mart stand out from other consumer brands.
Beyond the dollars invested in overseas outlets, the company's true advantage stems from 14 years of experience nurturing IP in a market environment – and supply chain – ripe for widespread merchandising.
Pop Mart's extensive IP family spans artist originals like MOLLY, The Monsters (which includes Labubu), Skullpanda, Dimoo, and Hirono, as well as popular licensed series featuring Disney, Harry Potter, Sanrio, and Nezha.
Keeping up this pipeline of fresh designs will be crucial for sustaining growth.
As Pop Mart expands abroad, CEO Wang Ning also sees a need for better organizational structures.
Initially, to keep local teams nimble, management gave overseas branches plenty of autonomy in hiring, marketing, and expansion.
Now that international sales are so significant, however, tighter oversight is essential.
Wang has separated US operations from the broader overseas division, handing management to the home office. This should help domestic teams learn more about foreign markets and foster smoother collaboration.
""It's like merging an independent unit into the main force. We must empower them,"" Wang says, adding that Pop Mart will establish additional regional headquarters in Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia.
These reforms demand stronger capabilities in overseas operations. Although long lines often signal popularity, they can also deter shoppers.
Wang wants to enhance online options, streamline store operations, expand checkout space, and speed up logistics.
""We need to mature and become more confident,"" he frequently reminds his teams abroad.
Morgan Stanley analyst Dustin Wei sees Pop Mart as potentially the first Chinese consumer brand to succeed globally by focusing on IP, design, and product appeal rather than cost. In his words, Pop Mart is a ""rising global brand.""

MicroPort CardioFlow,Boston Scientific leads $175M investment in 4C Medical - MedTech Dive,2025-03-06 08:00:00,"Dive Brief:
- Boston Scientific led a $175 million investment in heart disease device developer 4C Medical Technologies.
- The investment, which 4C Medical disclosed Wednesday, will support an ongoing pivotal trial of the company’s transcatheter mitral valve replacement device in the U.S. and Europe.
- 4C Medical’s focus on minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease aligns with Boston Scientific’s activities. Boston Scientific has a history of buying companies in its venture portfolio.
Dive Insight:
The $175 million series D financing round marks a step up in 4C Medical’s spending power. The company first disclosed funding in 2017, when it raised approximately $9 million, and last added to its bank balance when it closed a $35.4 million series C round in 2022.
Microport Cardioflow, a Chinese developer of transcatheter aortic valves, led the series C round with a $25 million investment. 4C Medical granted Microport exclusive commercial rights for a tricuspid product in China. An unnamed “multinational strategic investor” led a $17 million financing in 2018.
4C Medical, in the latest funding announcement, said new and existing shareholders joined with Boston Scientific for the series D round. The syndicate has equipped 4C Medical to run a pivotal trial that began enrolling patients in the U.S. in October.
The study is enrolling 450 people, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. The target population is patients with mitral regurgitation who are unsuitable for surgery or transcatheter edge-to-edge repair with devices such as Abbott’s Mitraclip. The primary endpoint is looking at a composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization and has a primary completion date of September 2029.
Jeff Chambers, chairman of the board at 4C Medical, said in a statement that the financing “strategically positions us to accelerate our progress towards device commercialization.” Boston Scientific has a track record of funding medtech companies through data readouts that inform the prospects of their devices.
The company made 10 venture investments in 2024, Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January. Boston Scientific CFO Daniel Brennan provided an update on the size of portfolio at a TD Cowen event this week, telling attendees that it includes almost 50 companies.
The investments give Boston Scientific a chance to evaluate potential M&A targets.
“I don't know the exact percent, but I bet ... about 25% to 30% of the companies we acquire come from our venture portfolio,” Mahoney said in January. “It's a great way for us to look at disruptive technologies to further increase our weighted average market growth rate.”

The GC’s steak-tacular hall of flame.
First and foremost: our sin-sear-est apologies in advance to our plant-based brethren, with this roundup including exactly zero cauli steaks.
For the meat eaters among us, if it’s sear-riously good steak you seek, you are definitely in the right place. There are not many dishes that compare to the satisfaction of a succulent steak cooked to perfection, though there is often a lot more to the art of this dish than meats the eye.
When the urge for a next level steak won’t quit, sometimes you just have to leave it in the hands of the pros. Sit back and grillax, we’ve got those carnivorous cravings covered. Here are 10 of the GC’s most lit steak restaurants worth getting fired up over.
Lars Bar & Grill burst onto the Nobby Beach scene last year, firing up the grill and bringing a perfect blend of woodfired magic and laid-back luxury to The Oxley 1823. Led by Lars Kollrepp – son of local legend Marty Kollrepp – this hotspot serves up a fine dining feast with a coastal twist. And when it comes to steak, they are a cut above. With over ten cuts on the menu (yep, you read that right!), from melt-in-your-mouth eye fillet to a beastly T-bone, they’re seriously raising the steaks. Whether you’re soaking up the vibes indoors, kicking back alfresco, or feeling extra fancy in the private dining room, Lars has everything you need for a sizzling night out.
Where: 2217 Gold Coast Highway, Mermaid Beach
Craving a homemade feast but don’t feel like firing up the stove? Mike’s Kitchen has you covered. Housed in a charming Tudor-style building, this spot is serving up old-school steakhouse vibes with a fresh twist. The legendary ribs – slow-cooked to perfection, then flame-kissed for that smoky, finger-licking goodness – have a fan club of their own. Now let’s talk about the steak. These premium aged cuts are matured for peak flavour and melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, setting the bar high for serious carnivores. Got little foodies in tow? No worries – there’s a dedicated kids’ menu to keep the whole family happy. So loosen that belt, grab a seat, and get ready to dig in!
Where: 2 Gooding Drive, Merrimac
For a steak night with a side of glamour, make your way to Coast Beach Bar & Kitchen, perched on the first floor of the jaw-dropping 76-storey Ocean by Meriton in Surfers Paradise. This coastal hotspot serves up a high-steaks dining experience that’s worth every bite. Spread across multiple dining areas, it’s got room for you, your crew and all the indulgence your heart desires. Every cut is kissed by fire in a Josper charcoal oven, infused with the rich, smoky magic of native red gum wood. Sharing is encouraged (but no judgment if you’re steaking your claim on the last bite). For pure carnivorous bliss, sink your teeth into the Tajima wagyu rump or WX wagyu rump cap – so tender and juicy, you’ll be back before your cravings have time to cool.

Mermaid’s moody gastro-pub has garnered itself a solid rep indeed for punching out sear-riously good steaks over the years. These guys take their meat even more seriously than that one mate bordering on a situationship with their smoker, with a full breakdown of cut / weight / breed / producer / paddock / region / feed to agonise over. There are no less than nine top-quality cuts on offer from all over Aus (and that’s not including the stacked selection of share-style dishes) – making this a must-try destination for even the most discerning steak critics (*cough* looking at you, aforementioned mate with smoker).

There’s an assortment of steak cuts to acquaint yourself with, including a signature Dry Age Steak if you’re feeling a little lot extra.
Where: 3 Oracle Blvd, Broadbeach
For born and bred locals, the former Labrador icon (affectionately known simply as Cav’s in our youths) summons a whole lot of nostalgia, and thankfully it still stands up to the hype and fond mems all these years on. In fact, this is one GC institution that has aged like fine wine (they’ve got those too), with a rooftop vibing re-location and grown up new look to match that signature Cav’s experience we’ve known for ~40 years now. They’ve got this steak business down to a fine art, with a sister butchery, an extensive selection of cuts and that traditional steak experience with all the classic trimmings – bc sometimes you just need a decadent, garlic prawn laden steak in your life.
Where: 6 Bayview Street, Runaway Bay
Another GC mainstay, Moo Moo’s has been serving up all the mouth-watering meat action (and resulting meat sweats) to Broadbeach and beyond going on 20 years now, and they’ve got the receipts – aka slew of awards to prove it. Specialty steaks are kind of their thing (as are fine wines), with ten mouth-watering options to choose from – though if you and a willing participant have brought your appetite, take on the infamous Spice Rubbed 1kg Wagyu Rump Cap Roast. Carved at the table served with Wagyu Fat Fried New Season Potatoes (and some green stuff for good measure).
Where: 2685 Gold Coast Highway, Broadbeach
A spot well known for dishing up the finer things, with a little help from some epic views of the GC skyline, The Darling’s crowning jewel Nineteen at The Star is the kinda place that has it all. Naturally, there’s an equally impressive selection of swanky steaks, which are almost exclusively sourced locally on the Darling Downs (with exception to the Cape Grim Grass Fed Rib Eye, which, we can definitely manage to let slide, quite frankly). If it’s truly time to treat yourself, these guys boast one of the largest selections of sumptuous 9+ MBS (aka ‘excellent’ grade) steaks on the Coast – the only thing higher is that stunner of an outlook, tbh.

Chinasoft International,Strengthening China’s soft power - thesun.my,2025-02-25 08:00:00,"CHINA has overtaken the UK to secure second place globally, advancing one position from the previous year, according to the Global Soft Power Index 2025.
The latest report by the influential brand valuation consultancy, Brand Finance, highlights China’s remarkable progress in the ranking, reflecting its growing power and influence in world politics and international relations.
This report is based primarily on key indicators in economics and business while also measuring attributes related to culture
and heritage, media and communication, education and science and sustainability.
Together, these factors are increasingly seen as the more influential and effective side of the power coin as compared with the flip side of hard power, which is associated with military power and intervention, coercive diplomacy and economic sanction.
The report notes that China has retained the top spot globally for “ease of doing business in and with” and “future growth potential” for
the past four consecutive years. This is a picture quite different from the portrayal of “China collapsing” and “China in economic crisis” regularly featured in Western mainstream media and reproduced by supporting Asian media.
What is also notable is that China has soared to seventh place in the rankings for culture and heritage and media and communication attributes.
This trend is strengthening with the further opening up of the country to foreign visitors as well as the global impact of the movie Ne Zha2 (NZ2) and artificial intelligence (AI) app DeepSeek.
The impact of the latter two soft power successes in their respective fields has been so significant that even Western media outlets like CNN, BBC and The New York Times – known for engaging in anti-China reporting and ignoring or marginalising Chinese achievements – have been reluctantly aroused to run stories on them, albeit with their mandatory negative comments.
Movie megahit
NZ2, the latest China-produced animation film hit, with its storyline of family, friendship, loyalty and sacrifice encapsulated within a framework of Chinese mythology and techno-wizardry has captivated movie audiences wherever shown.
It is expected to generate more than US$2 billion (RM8.79 billion) in box office takings. This will make it the highest-ranking box office animated film in the world.
What is appealing to movie fans, especially American audiences viewing it in the small number of cinemas it is showing – 300 of the 9,595 movie theatres in the US – are not just the universal themes of courage and resilience but also the absence of messages relating to wokeness, political correctness and attitude.
Unlike in the West, where cultural dominance has been based on colonial conquest, religious expansion and political dominance, this example of
film-making and cultural influence is different.
In today’s high-tech era, films like NZ2 demonstrate how technology, storytelling and cultural heritage can converge to create a new film-making and culture-dissemination model rooted in non-ideological equality and dialogue rather than the legacy Western model, with its message of white, Christian and ideological goodness, superiority and supremacy.
Movie audiences are no strangers to mythology-based storytelling. However, Chinese and other non-Western mythology and storylines have been under-explored in the global entertainment world despite their rich history and universal themes.
This is not only due to cultural and historical differences. It is more importantly an outcome of American dominance in the development of the movie industry since the early 20th century.
Hollywood, with US government support, has dominated the world box office for more than a century and helped to shape how audiences in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America view the US and the world.
Whilst this trend continues today, the success of NZ2 and
its sequel should encourage other countries to embrace cultural confidence and have the ability to tell their own stories. This, in turn, will influence the soft power and global rankings of nations worldwide.
Sputnik moment and bombshell impact
NZ2 comes on the heels of DeepSeek, with the latter emerging like a bombshell in app stores around the world.
As the most downloaded AI app, replacing ChatGPT, the Chinese AI model has significantly impacted the global tech industry by its cost-effective low-budget development. This has caused major tech stocks to plummet and raised questions about the shifting power dynamics in the AI market.
Many now see China as a major player in AI development that can challenge Western AI apps presently dominating the market and tech giants, such as Microsoft and Google.
What is important to the five billion smartphone users in the world – they account for over 60% of the world’s population – is not that it is a Chinese app, but that it is free.
For those using it, DeepSeek has pioneered and opened the door to an open-source app that can be used and modified easily, and without the need to pay a fee or royalty.
DeepSeek and NZ2 are not the only examples of China’s growing soft power. They follow Huawei, BYD, TikTok, Red Note and other recent China innovations and products developed entirely or mainly with homegrown talent, whose ripple effects are affecting and undermining the US and Western domination of the existing world order.
Global power balance
Perhaps the greatest asset to China’s influence in the world for now comes from an unlikely source – President Donald Trump.
As the world’s greatest political influencer and newsmaker, Trump, in his mission to “Make America Great Again”, has embarked on a foreign policy campaign that has made US allies realise their client status means their interests will inevitably be placed on the sacrificial table if they stand in the way of Trump’s redefinition of American hard and soft power and relations with Russia, China or any other traditional or new adversary.
Combined with China’s burgeoning soft power achievements and Belt and Road Initiative, with its emphasis on economic development and regional connectivity to bring about shared prosperity, this will result in the rapid remaking of the current world order to a more equitable and inclusive multipolar one.
Lim Teck Ghee’s Another Take is aimed at demystifying social orthodoxy.

SMI Semiconductor,Flawed Diamonds Are a Quantum Sensor’s Best Friend - IEEE Spectrum,2025-02-23 08:00:00,"Quantum sensors take the biggest roadblock for quantum computers—unwanted interference, or noise—and turn it into a strength. Noise wrecks quantum computers because the quantum states they use for computation are affected by the slightest disturbances from the environment. But quantum sensors use those disturbances to detect minuscule changes in magnetic and electric fields.
Amanda Stein, the CEO of Quantum Catalyzer (Q-Cat), is working to find meaningful markets for sensors based on quantum defects in diamond. IEEE Spectrumspoke with her about the challenges in doing so.
Amanda Stein
Amanda Stein is the CEO of Quantum Catalyzer (Q-Cat), a startup founded in 2020 to explore and incubate quantum tech companies.
How can defects in diamonds be used as sensors?
Amanda Stein: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are defects in specially grown diamonds where neighboring carbon atoms in the crystal lattice have been replaced by a nitrogen atom and a vacancy—a missing carbon atom. The NV defect allows for precise sensing because the NV exhibits excellent quantum behavior—discrete energy levels, spin, and the ability to absorb and emit individual photons—while protected by the robust diamond host. For example, a tiny change in magnetic field can shift the NV’s energy levels, which induces a measurable change in the rate of photons the NV emits.
How do you find industries that could benefit from quantum sensors?
Stein: We look for areas where diamond sensors can add value. The biggest areas are in rugged environments, because diamond is an extremely robust material. So industries like space, and oil and gas.
Diamond sensors don’t need a lot of calibration, and with some technological advancements could be made calibration free. So it could be good for long-term accuracy. And you can detect magnetic fields, temperature, pressure, potentially even gravity, with one sensor. In a rugged environment, it’s valuable to replace multiple sensors with just one.
What is your first spin-off, EuQlid, contributing to the semiconductor industry?
Stein: We’ve built something called the quantum diamond microscope, which can create an image of magnetic fields with micron-scale resolution over a wide field of view. It’s quite unique, especially when applied to the semiconductor world. Currents flowing within wires are producing magnetic fields, and we can trace these magnetic fields noninvasively. And we are able to see inside some new packaging techniques without using X-rays, which can be damaging.
What are some other industries in which quantum sensors could have an impact?
Stein: We’re exploring areas like artwork and high value objects. All paint has some magnetic properties, and with our extreme sensitivity, we potentially could see where paint is degrading, or maybe even where Van Gogh started something else and changed his mind along the way.
Another exciting area is in bio. One of the hypotheses that we have is that tumor cells carry a higher level of iron than healthy cells. So potentially, we could use our tools for pathology.
What’s next for quantum sensing?
Stein: We’re also looking into other materials, like silicon carbide and graphene.
I think as quantum sensing advances and starts providing more solutions, people will be more aware of what it can actually do. It still takes a lot of money and tech development, but it’s a lot more near term, in my opinion, than quantum computing.

Chinasoft International,China overtakes the UK to claim second place in Global Soft Power Index 2025 - Brand Finance,2025-02-20 08:00:00,"New report from Brand Finance reveals China retains first place in ‘easy to do business in and with’ and ‘future growth’ for four consecutive years
BEIJING, 21 February 2025 – China has overtaken the UK to secure 2nd place globally, advancing one position from the previous year, with a score of 72.8 out of 100 – its highest ranking to date – in the Global Soft Power Index 2025.
According to a new report from Brand Finance, the world's leading brand valuation consultancy, this remarkable progress underscores China’s growing soft power across key pillars, including Culture & Heritage, Media & Communication, Education & Science, and Sustainability, and a steady ranking for business-centric attributes, reflects the nation’s expanding global influence and its strategic positioning in shaping the future of these vital domains.
China has achieved an outstanding 8.8 points in the Business & Trade pillar, ranking 4th globally and excelling in several key attributes. The country ranked 1st globally for both the 'ease of doing business in and with' and 'future growth potential' attributes for four consecutive years. Additionally, China has risen to 5th place (up 1 position) for 'products and brands the world loves' and maintained its 8th place ranking for 'a strong and stable economy' since 2024. This remarkable performance highlights China's growing influence and its continued strength in key global sectors.
The nation is also highly regarded in the Culture and Heritage pillar, securing 7th place globally (up 1 place). It has maintained its position at 9th for ‘influential in arts and entertainment’ and 8th for ‘food the world loves’ for two consecutive years. Demonstrating its rich cultural influence, China ranks 3rd globally for ‘rich heritage’, reinforcing its prominent place in shaping global cultural narratives. This continued success highlights China’s enduring legacy and its strong presence in the cultural and heritage sectors worldwide.
China’s Media and Communication pillar has made steady progress, advancing one rank from 8th to 7th this year. This growth is driven by attributes such as ‘affairs I follow closely’, which rose to 3rd place (up 3 positions), and ‘influential media’, where the nation has maintained its 5th place ranking since 2024. This progress further cements China’s global standing in both cultural and media influence, reinforcing its prominent role in shaping global narratives across arts, entertainment, and communication.
Scott Chen, Managing Director China, Brand Finance, commented:
""China's strong performance in the Global Soft Power Index 2025 offers valuable insights into its strategic growth across various sectors, amplifying its role as a global leader. By achieving remarkable scores in business and trade, alongside its consistent strength in culture and heritage, China demonstrates its ability to influence global narratives. The country’s continued progress in media and communication, combined with its focus on sustainability and technological innovation, highlights the breadth of its influence. These achievements showcase how China is shaping the future of the global economy, culture, and sustainable development, offering lessons on the power of strategic growth and global engagement.""
For four consecutive years, China has held its position at 3rd in the Education & Science pillar, demonstrating its commitment to advancing in these crucial fields. The nation excels in global soft power rankings, securing 3rd place for 'advanced in science', 2nd place for 'advanced in technology and innovation', and 2nd place for 'invests in space exploration'. These achievements highlight China’s long-standing emphasis on fostering educational excellence, scientific progress, and technological innovation, reinforcing its role as a global leader in shaping the future of education, science, and innovation worldwide.
China's commitment to Sustainability is equally noteworthy, as it rises to 14th in the global rankings, climbing 4 places. The country excels in ‘sustainable cities and transport’, securing 5th place (up 7 positions), driven by strategic initiatives such as the Belt and Road projects, a heightened focus on sustainability, stronger domestic brands, and the post-pandemic economic reopening. Additionally, China ranks 9th (up 4 places) for ‘investing in green energy and technologies’, underscoring its dedication to building a more sustainable future. This progress reflects China’s growing role as a global leader in sustainability, where its focus on green innovation and eco-friendly development continues to shape its future.

This comprehensive research assesses perceptions of all 193 United Nations member states across 55 metrics, delivering a detailed view of how nations influence preferences and behaviours on the global stage through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion.
The Global Soft Power Index offers invaluable insights into the evolving dynamics of soft power as nations navigate complex global challenges, providing a comprehensive benchmark for assessing a nation’s influence and appeal on the world stage.
Global Insights: U.S. Leads Global Soft Power, China Rises to Second Spot
The United States maintains its position at the top of the ranking with an all-time highest Global Soft Power Index score of 79.5 out of 100. Once again, it leads in the Familiarity and Influence Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), three out of eight Soft Power pillars, and ranks highest in 12 out of the 35 nation brand attributes.
For the first time, China has surpassed the UK to rank 2nd with a score of 72.8 out of 100 - its highest ever position. Since 2024, China has recorded statistically significant growth across six of the eight Soft Power pillars, and in two-thirds of measured attributes, stemming from strategic efforts including Belt and Road projects, an increased focus on sustainability, stronger domestic brands, and post-pandemic reopening to visitors.
At the same time, the United Kingdom’s drop to third place behind China reflects a period of stagnation in its nation brand perceptions. While scores remain relatively stable, a lack of progress across key pillars – especially Business & Trade, down to 6th, and Governance, down to 3rd, are an argument that the UK should bolster its Soft Power strategy.
El Salvador is 2025’s fastest-rising nation, climbing 35 spots to 82nd with a +3.2-point increase in its Soft Power score. El Salvador has significantly reduced gang violence and homicides, with improving views of El Salvador as ‘safe and secure’ and ‘politically stable and well governed’. El Salvador has also advanced in Business & Trade - its 2021 decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, though controversial, has attracted significant attention.
Brand Finance is the world’s leading brand valuation consultancy. Bridging the gap between marketing and finance, Brand Finance evaluates the strength of brands and quantifies their financial value to help organisations make strategic decisions.
Headquartered in London, Brand Finance operates in over 25 countries. Every year, Brand Finance conducts more than 6,000 brand valuations, supported by original market research, and publishes over 100 reports which rank brands across all sectors and countries.
Brand Finance also operates the Global Brand Equity Monitor, conducting original market research annually on 6,000 brands, surveying more than 175,000 respondents across 41 countries and 31 industry sectors. By combining perceptual data from the Global Brand Equity Monitor with data from its valuation database — the largest brand value database in the world — Brand Finance equips ambitious brand leaders with the data, analytics, and the strategic guidance they need to enhance brand and business value.
In addition to calculating brand value, Brand Finance also determines the relative strength of brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance, compliant with ISO 20671.
Brand Finance is a regulated accountancy firm and a committed leader in the standardisation of the brand valuation industry. Brand Finance was the first to be certified by independent auditors as compliant with both ISO 10668 and ISO 20671 and has received the official endorsement of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) in the United States.
Brand is defined as a marketing-related intangible asset including, but not limited to, names, terms, signs, symbols, logos, and designs, intended to identify goods, services, or entities, creating distinctive images and associations in the minds of stakeholders, thereby generating economic benefits.
Brand strength is the efficacy of a brand’s performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. Brand Finance evaluates brand strength in a process compliant with ISO 20671, looking at Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and the impact of those on Business Performance. The data used is derived from Brand Finance’s proprietary market research programme and from publicly available sources.
Each brand is assigned a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score out of 100, which feeds into the brand value calculation. Based on the score, each brand is assigned a corresponding Brand Rating up to AAA+ in a format similar to a credit rating.
Brand Finance calculates the values of brands in its rankings using the Royalty Relief approach – a brand valuation method compliant with the industry standards set in ISO 10668. It involves estimating the likely future revenues that are attributable to a brand by calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for its use, to arrive at a ‘brand value’ understood as a net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market.
The steps in this process are as follows:
1 Calculate brand strength using a balanced scorecard of metrics assessing Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and Business Performance. Brand strength is expressed as a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score on a scale of 0 to 100.
2 Determine royalty range for each industry, reflecting the importance of brand to purchasing decisions. In luxury, the maximum percentage is high, while in extractive industry, where goods are often commoditised, it is lower. This is done by reviewing comparable licensing agreements sourced from Brand Finance’s extensive database.
3 Calculate royalty rate. The BSI score is applied to the royalty range to arrive at a royalty rate. For example, if the royalty range in a sector is 0-5% and a brand has a BSI score of 80 out of 100, then an appropriate royalty rate for the use of this brand in the given sector will be 4%.
4 Determine brand-specific revenues by estimating a proportion of parent company revenues attributable to a brand.
5 Determine forecast revenues using a function of historic revenues, equity analyst forecasts, and economic growth rates.
6 Apply the royalty rate to the forecast revenues to derive brand revenues.
7 Discount post-tax brand revenues to a net present value which equals the brand value.

According to the bell, SK hynix is incorporating chiplet technology into its first in-house CXL controller, which will reportedly be manufactured by TSMC.
According to the report, SK hynix applied the CXL controller from China’s Montage Technology in its CMM-DDR5 in 2024. Now it prepares to produce its own CXL controllers for CXL 3.0 and 3.1., the report adds.
As per the bell, SK hynix is also exploring 2.5D and Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging (FOWLP), as it prepares to commercialize chiplet technology.
The report adds that chiplets use multiple controller dies connected via Mosaic Link (M.link). SK hynix’s in-house CXL controller die will likely use TSMC’s advanced process, while M.link is expected to adopt a 12nm process.
Another report from MTN News indicates that SK hynix plans to begin mass production of CXL-based DDR5 memory (CXL Memory Module) by the end of the first quarter.
CXL is a next-gen interface which connects CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, and DRAM. Its key advantage, according to the bell, would be maximizing memory scalability—unlike traditional DRAM limited to memory slots, CXL DRAM leverages PCIe slots to expand capacity over 10 times.
Notably, SK hynix isn’t the only memory giant eyeing the CXL market. Samsung launched the industry’s first CXL-based DRAM module (CMM-D) in 2021 and unveiled the upgraded CMM-D 2.0 in May 2022, featuring a 512GB module with higher bandwidth and lower latency, according to its website.

SMI Semiconductor,"Trump's tariff plans: What to expect from chip, autos players - Yahoo Finance",2025-02-19 08:00:00,"In This Article:
President Donald Trump proposed new 25% tariffs that could target semiconductor, automobile, and pharmaceutical imports into the US.
Lopez Research founder Maribel Lopez joins Morning Brief to highlight this as a starting point for negotiations, emphasizing that the actual tariff rate is yet to be determined.
""This is really an opening volley by Trump to say he's really serious about tariffs. Tariffs will happen. The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is still unknown,"" Lopez explains.
She highlights that industries like the automotive sector, with a strong US presence, may have a better chance of negotiating exemptions.
""The call to action for everybody right now is to try to figure out what they can do to make a play to say that they're going to invest in America — to either create manufacturing jobs, to create investment in some other type of category that we would consider as beneficial to the economy,"" Lopez explains.
While acknowledging the seriousness of tariffs, Lopez reassures that the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) is not overreacting yet as the Trump administration continues to negotiate with international officials.
President Donald Trump threatening those levies of 25% or more on semiconductor imports. So joining us now with more on this, we got Maribel Lopez, the founder of Lopez Research. Maribel, it's great to have you on here. I want to talk specifically about the impact of these tariffs on some of these chips names, in particular that drove the market to all-time highs early this week. Is the market missing something sinister when it comes to tariffs, or is the market right to kind of be sloughing off any potential negative impact?
This is really an opening volley by Trump to say he's really serious about tariffs. Tariffs will happen. The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is is still unknown. So this is like, hey, I'm throwing it out there. You're going to come to me, we're going to have a negotiation, we're going to try to figure out how you were going to invest more in America. And that's really what I see as the statement that Trump is making here. This is why we're looking at April and not tomorrow. If we're looking at April, there's plenty of time for someone like TSMC to call and say, hey, here's how we're feeling about investing more in foundries in the US as an example. Same for Samsung and other companies that already build chips here, but not at a very significant standpoint.
Are there industries that you think are more likely to be successful making sure that they're included in an exemptions or an exclusions list as they try to vie for the ear and and the mind of the President?
So some companies actually already have a strong foothold. You mentioned the automotive industry. If you look at somebody like BMW, they already manufacture a significant portion of what they sell in the US, upwards of about 50% in the US. So they actually have a better negotiating ability than say Samsung who does manufacture some goods here, such as some of their home products, but not necessarily enough. So we're seeing that it is widely unevenly distributed across the various companies and across the various sectors. But I think the call to action for everybody right now is to try to figure out what they can do to make a play to say that they're going to invest in America to either create manufacturing jobs, to create investment in some other type of category that we would consider as beneficial to the economy. And this is why the fund managers are not overreacting to the statement at this point because they understand at this moment, it's still a negotiation.
So it sounds like you think the market is right to view this as that negotiation, not as something more serious. But do you think that the Trump administration is kind of angling towards universal tariffs by throwing out these larger numbers, like a 25% to kick off those negotiations, and could there be risk associated with that?
I think they're incredibly serious about tariffs across the board. I think this is definitely a statement that says, no industry, no country will remain unscathed by tariffs, and that you have to have a plan on how to work with us. We are serious about rebalancing, whatever they think rebalancing means, but they have definitely indicated that they are serious about it. So the real thing to watch here to your earlier point is, when do they come in effect, how long do we expect them to be in effect, and what would be considered a sufficient and necessary investment in the US. But clearly, there are many companies that are looking at this saying, if you were a auto manufacturer, say in Japan, if you are a semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan, you're looking at, what could this do to my profitability? How do I find a way to make sure that there's a sufficient investment that we don't end up with a 25% tariff, which is a significant number for any company.

Since its rapid rise, the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek has faced considerable scrutiny from some Western countries but that is unlikely to be the case in the Global South where observers say it offers great potential.

DeepSeek, the Hangzhou-based firm that rocked the world with the launch of its large language model last month, has been touted by one professor as a “gift to the developing world”.
According to observers, this means DeepSeek’s success could be a huge boost for China’s soft power, especially in the developing world, as Beijing seeks to further expand its influence in the Global South.
Stephen Minas, a professor at Peking University’s school of transnational law, argued in an Australian magazine article this month that poorer nations could take advantage of opportunities brought by DeepSeek’s success, including its open-source nature that would make it “easier for others to learn from and iterate”.
DeepSeek grabbed global attention by creating a powerful AI model at a significantly lower cost. And unlike its Western competitors, it adopted an open-source approach, meaning its algorithm is freely available for anyone to use and access.

The new plant will more than triple its floor space in Malaysia to about 3.4 million square feet, according to a statement. ASE, the world’s largest provider of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test services, said it will hire an additional 1,500 employees “over the next few years” for the plant.

Chinasoft International,Trump’s assault on USAID leaves China soft power opening in Southeast Asia - Al Jazeera,2025-02-13 08:00:00,"Trump’s assault on USAID leaves China soft power opening in Southeast Asia
Washington’s retreat from the region leaves space that Beijing may be keen to fill, analysts say.
As the United States winds back humanitarian assistance in Southeast Asia, its rival China may see an opportunity to expand its influence in a region where it has directed billions of dollars in investment and aid, analysts say.
In a little over three weeks since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Washington has frozen nearly all foreign aid and moved to effectively abolish the US Agency for International Development (USAID), a longstanding source of soft power in the region.

US judge orders Trump administration to obey halt on spending freeze
USAID, the biggest disburser of US foreign aid, spent $860m in Southeast Asia alone last year, funding projects on everything from treating HIV to preserving biodiversity and strengthening local governance.
Many projects, which run primarily through grants to local NGOs, face an uncertain future as the Trump administration pulls the US back from the world stage as part of his “America first” agenda.
For Beijing, the circumstances provide an ideal opportunity for it to step in, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
“The suspension of health, education, and humanitarian programmes – key pillars of US soft power – may create vacuums that China can fill,” Huang told Al Jazeera.
“This strategic retreat could strengthen Beijing’s influence across the region, particularly in current US aid recipients like Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Cambodia.”
As the Trump administration generated headlines with its moves to gut USAID last week, Beijing made news by stepping in with $4.4m to fund a de-mining project in Cambodia that had been left in the lurch by Washington.
Heng Ratana, head of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre, told the Khmer Times newspaper the Chinese aid would help his organisation clear more than 3,400 hectares (8,400 acres) of land filled with landmines and unexploded ordnance.
China’s embassies in the US, Cambodia and Thailand did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.
Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said USAID’s demise comes as US influence in the region is waning more generally and as China scales up its public diplomacy.
Southeast Asian leaders are concerned about “chaotic policymaking” in the US, Kurlantzick told Al Jazeera, particularly in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, where the US devotes significant aid and security assistance.
“Beijing is indeed already portraying the US as uncaring and unable to lead regionally or globally and I expect Beijing to increase its aid and investment now in many parts of the developing world,” Kurlantzick told Al Jazeera.
While the future of many USAID programmes in the region is unclear, some analysts believe that China is likely to leave projects with a more political or ideological focus to other partners to the region, such as the European Union, Australia, Japan or the Asian Development Project, a Manila-based regional development bank.
“China’s existing international aid or international development programme is quite sizeable. But it happens to be quite different from what USAID does in that the latter seems to be devoting a lot of resources to ideology-based initiatives, for democracy, for LGBTQ, for diversity, for inclusiveness, for climate change,” John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told Al Jazeera.
“Whether China is going to step into the void vacated by the United States, I am very sceptical. We are talking about different things here. And besides, I don’t think the Chinese government is keen on competing with Washington on this front,” Gong said.
China’s foreign assistance has been heavily geared towards infrastructure, as laid out in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing’s flagship infrastructure investment project estimated to be worth more than $1 trillion.
Other projects, such as its hospital ship Peace Ark, have provided medical assistance.
Almost all of China’s foreign aid to Southeast Asia – some 85 percent – has taken the form of non-concessional loans with a focus on energy and transport, according to Grace Stanhope, a research associate at the Lowy Institute’s Indo-Pacific Development Centre.
Beijing’s infrastructure-heavy approach has made it a visible presence in the region, albeit not always a popular one, Stanhope told Al Jazeera, due to delays and “blow-out” budgets for projects such as the East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia and Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail line in Indonesia.
Some critics have referred to these and other projects as a form of “debt-trap” diplomacy intended to breed dependency on China, a charge Beijing has denied.
In a survey carried out by the Singapore-based Iseas Yusof-Ishak Institute last year, 59.5 percent of respondents across 10 Southeast Asian countries chose China as the most influential economic power in the region.
Just over half, however, expressed distrust of China, with 45.5 percent fearing that China could threaten their country economically or militarily. Japan was seen as the “most trusted” major power, followed by the US and the EU.
Though heavily focused on infrastructure, China has been slowly trying to shift its model of assistance towards more “soft” aid such as public health, agriculture and digitisation, said Joanne Lin, a senior fellow at the Iseas Yusof-Ishak Institute’s ASEAN studies centre in Singapore.
“The extent of China’s aid will of course depend on China’s economic ability as it is facing constraints such as its slowing growth and trade tensions with Washington which may limit its ability to replace US aid in full,” Lin told Al Jazeera.
Lin said Southeast Asian countries prefer a “diversified approach” to foreign aid and development assistance that is not dependent on a single donor – whether the US or China.
Despite its high-profile presence in Southeast Asia, China has been scaling back its development assistance in the region in recent years.
While China was the region’s top donor from 2015 to 2019, it has since slid to fourth place, according to the Lowy Institute.
Funding has similarly dried up, falling from $10bn in 2017 to $3bn in 2022, according to the think tank.
China faces its own problems at home, including slowing economic growth and high youth unemployment, that could limit its focus on affairs overseas, said Steve Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.
“The domestic issues may serve to limit [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] attention to international affairs. The issues with Belt and Road may limit the regime’s options for how to step into spaces left by the US,” Balla told Al Jazeera.
Dr. Fitriani, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, expressed a similar sentiment.
“China is already capitalising on US disengagement in the first Trump era by deepening its economic, diplomatic and cultural influence in Southeast Asia. Initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, Confucius, and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism are tools for expanding soft power,” Fitriani told Al Jazeera, referring to a global programme to promote the study of Chinese language and culture, and a forum to promote cooperation between China and the Mekong subregion.
“However, China’s lowering economic growth means slowing BRI, resulting in the country’s soft power project might be less aggressive than in the past decade. High-profile debt concerns and pushback against Chinese influence [in Malaysia and Indonesia] also limit its appeal,” she said.","[{'head': 'China', 'relation': 'invested_in', 'subtype': 'financial_support', 'tail': 'Cambodia'}, {'head': 'China', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'President', 'tail': 'Xi Jinping'}]","['steve balla', 'trump', 'eu', 'the lowy institute', 'the university of international business and economics', 'heng ratana', 'grace stanhope', 'xi jinping’s', 'usaid', 'the european union', 'al jazeera’s', 'the us agency for', 'lin', 'yanzhong huang', 'george washington university', 'balla', 'the asian development project', 'stanhope', 'iseas yusof-ishak institute', 'the lancang-mekong cooperation', 'joanne lin', 'joshua kurlantzick', 'al jazeera', 'fitriani', 'kurlantzick', 'donald trump', 'huang', 'the council on foreign relations', 'belt', 'the khmer times', 'regional development bank', 'the lowy institute’s indo-pacific development centre', 'confucius', 'international development (usaid', 'bri', 'the australian strategic policy institute', 'john gong', 'asean', 'the cambodian mine action centre']","- The Trump administration has frozen nearly all foreign aid and moved to abolish USAID, significantly impacting US soft power in Southeast Asia.

Brain tumors represent a significant burden, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to neuroimaging techniques is often limited. Conventional MRI machines are expensive and bulky, posing a significant challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors in LMICs. However, an emerging technology, ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging (pULF-MRI), has the potential to address this limitation. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of post-contrast enhancement in a pULF-MRI scanner for brain tumor imaging in LMICs. A single case study was conducted, and post-contrast enhancement was successfully achieved, revealing the presence of a tumor which was subsequently confirmed on biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of post-contrast enhancement in a pULF-MRI scanner for brain tumor imaging. This technology has the potential to significantly improve access to neuroimaging in LMICs, leading to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of brain tumors. These promising results suggest that further studies are warranted to explore the potential of pULF-MRI for large-scale screening and diagnosis of brain tumors in LMICs. This can provide a future roadmap for neuroimaging in LMICs, providing a cost-effective and accessible way to diagnose and treat brain tumors, leading to improved healthcare outcomes with a further prospective clinical trial.
Introduction
Brain tumors are a major global health concern, causing significant illness and death (Rahman et al., 2009). The incidence of reported brain and spinal cancers varies greatly across countries, with the highest rates being in Europe and the lowest in Asia, primarily due to the difference in health systems infrastructure and inaccessibility to diagnostic services (Miranda-Filho et al., 2017). The diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors pose significant challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to neuroimaging techniques is often limited despite the alarmingly higher disease burden (Liu et al., 2021; Ogbole et al., 2018). The evident difference in available diagnostic amenities, from imaging to biopsy, in LMICs compared to High Income Countries (HIC) exacerbates the contrast in healthcare outcomes (Ogbole et al., 2018). Furthermore, financial constraints limit a comprehensive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) report, excluding modalities ranging from Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), functional MRI, and diffusion-weighted images (DWI; Helal et al., 2018). Therefore, the diagnosis and surgical interventions are based on the limited available protocols—greatly impacting neurosurgical outcomes (Incekara et al., 2016).
Conventional MRI machines are often inaccessible due to their cost and size (Sarracanie et al., 2015). An emerging new generation of ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging (pULF-MRI) scanners has the potential to address the limitations of current neuroimaging techniques in LMICs (Arnold et al., 2023; Wald et al., 2020). This budding technology uses lower magnetic fields, making it smaller, lighter, and cheaper. Thus, it can be used in remote or low-resource settings where traditional MRI machines are not practical as an imaging modality (Geethanath and Vaughan, 2019; Altaf et al., 2023).
The use of pULF-MRI has the potential to revolutionize neuroimaging in LMIC, providing a cost-effective and accessible way to diagnose and treat brain tumors (Murali et al., 2024). The accessibility provided by pULF-MRI allows for achievement of improved healthcare outcomes in LMIC settings and hence, a better understanding of the brain.
The effectiveness of gadolinium chelates as contrast agents in low-field MRI has been a topic of concern. However, these concerns are not significant for field strengths below 1 T. A study demonstrated their usefulness in MRI at a field strength of 0.5 T, and their efficacy has been confirmed across a wide range of field strengths, from as low as 0.15 T to as high as 1.5 T. Therefore, gadolinium chelates can be safely used as contrast agents in MRI across various field strengths without compromising their effectiveness (Ibrahim et al., 2024).
Recently, there has been interest in new contrast agents and their potential for MRI as alternatives to galdonium. Superparamagnetic or small particles of iron oxide have been utilized for liver imaging and have shown promising results for CNS applications. These particles offer a strong magnetic moment with a higher r2 and belong to the group of “negative enhancers,” predominantly causing strong susceptibility effects in a strong magnetic field. Macromolecular Gd-based agents, ranging from 64 to 17,500 d, have been investigated for tumor angiogenesis in breast carcinoma and as prognostic markers and surrogates for the pharmacokinetics of organs and tumors. Dendrimers are a type of macromolecular contrast media that have been investigated in preclinical settings for various applications. Contrast media for molecular imaging is currently only for preclinical utilization, with a particular interest in stem cell research for effective “cell labeling” and “cell tracking” (Rahman, 2023).
In this report, we discuss our experience from the first reported use of post-contrast MRI imaging using a pULF-MRI scanner for brain tumor imaging. This new technology utilizes modern hardware and new acquisition techniques, allowing low-cost scanners to acquire far superior diagnostic information compared to earlier generations of low-field MRI scanners. This makes pULF-MRI a potential screening tool, particularly in remote hospitals and medical clinic settings.
Case presentation
This case report features a 54-year-old female who had been experiencing headaches, dizziness, and gait disturbances for the past 4 months, with no prior significant medical history. Upon referral to our neurosurgery department, an MRI scan was ordered to investigate the cause of her symptoms. To investigate further, we decided to use a pULF-MRI scanner for the first time for post-contrast imaging of the patient's brain.
The scanner was small, lightweight, and had a much lower magnetic field strength, i.e., 0.064 Tesla, compared to conventional MRI machines, making it a safe and convenient option for the patient. The subject underwent a set of custom MRI sequences as per the Neurosurgeon's recommendations that included T2 Axial, T2 sagittal, T2 weighted FLAIR sequence, T1 Axial, and DWI + ADC sequences. This initial pre-contrast study comprised a total of 42 min. Immediately following this scan, our subject underwent a conventional High-field (1.5 Tesla) MRI scanner. Only a set of the neuronavigational study was carried out that comprised of T2 FLAIR, followed by administration of a dose of 0.10 mmol/kg gadolinium (Gd) chelate that is generally considered sufficient for contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 1.5 Tesla. This comprised of an additional 30 min. Following the high-field scan, a pULF-MRI scan was carried out based on the protocol outlined in Figure 1. For T1 and T2 sequences, the pixel spacing was set to 1.6 mm with a slice thickness of 5 mm. The FLAIR sequence was optimized with a repetition time (TR) of 4,000 ms and an echo time (TE) of 166.72 ms. For DWI and ADC sequences, TR was 1,000 ms, TE was 76.04 ms, pixel spacing was 2.4 mm, and slice thickness was 5.88 mm. These parameters were carefully selected to optimize image quality and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within the constraints of ultra-low-field MRI. Adjustments to TR and TE were made to balance image contrast and acquisition time, while pixel spacing and slice thickness were chosen to achieve adequate spatial resolution and coverage. No additional contrast medium was administered for this study.
A break of 15 min between the high-field and the post-contrast pULF-MRI scan was present. This accounted for the time taken to bring the scanner and positioning of the patient within the machine. The total scan time for this post-contrast scan was 31 min, altogether making up 103 min.
The T1 sequence of pre-operative tumor-related enhancement in the clival region is shown in Figure 2 of our report. Although the size of the deep unresected tumor remained unchanged in all four sequential scans, the enhancement appeared to intensify with each successive scan results achieved for the patient. Compared to standard MRI, pULF-MRI demonstrates a reduced contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and lower lesion conspicuity. In standard MRI, there is a clear differentiation between gray and white matter, with well-defined lesion margins and sharp contrast that enhances the visibility of pathological changes. Lesions appear distinctly against the background tissue, facilitating accurate detection. In contrast, pULF-MRI shows diminished gray-white matter differentiation, with increased background noise that obscures fine structural details. Lesion borders are less defined, and smaller lesions are more challenging to identify due to blurred margins and reduced contrast with surrounding tissue. While pULF-MRI offers imaging capabilities at ultra-low field strengths, its lower CNR and lesion conspicuity may limit diagnostic sensitivity, particularly for subtle or early-stage lesions.

The scan was performed without complications, and the resulting images were of high quality, with good contrast resolution between different tissues. The images revealed the presence of a small tumor in the patient's left temporal region which was subsequently confirmed through a biopsy.
True non-contrast (TNC) and Deep non-contrast (DNC) imaging techniques are foundational to brain MRI protocols, each with unique advantages. TNC imaging utilizes standard MRI sequences such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and DWI to provide a general assessment of structural abnormalities, including tumors, strokes, and edema. It is commonly used for routine diagnostic imaging and is particularly valuable in patients where contrast agents are contraindicated. In contrast, DNC imaging leverages advanced and specialized sequences, such as SWI (Susceptibility Weighted Imaging), ASL (Arterial Spin Labeling), or advanced diffusion techniques like DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging). These sequences are designed for higher resolution or targeted imaging of subtle abnormalities, often focusing on specific or deep brain structures. DNC imaging is frequently applied in advanced clinical scenarios, such as pre-surgical planning (He et al., 2020).
However, dual-layer spectral detector magnetic resonance imaging (SDMRI) is an advanced imaging technology that utilizes a dual-layer detector system to simultaneously capture high- and low-energy information during routine scans. This enables the generation of spectral-based imaging (SBI), which allows for the reconstruction of spectral multiparameter images for retrospective analysis. In brain MRI, virtual non-contrast (VNC) images can be reconstructed from contrast-enhanced scans by subtracting gadolinium-based contrast agent signals, producing images that closely resemble conventional plain scans like TNC scans. This innovative approach effectively eliminates the need for separate TNC scans, reducing scan time and improving patient comfort. VNC imaging has gained increasing application in neuroimaging, enabling the evaluation of various brain pathologies with enhanced diagnostic accuracy while minimizing patient exposure to additional contrast agents or prolonged scan durations. Additionally, pULF-MRI offers the advantage of VNC imaging, providing a versatile and patient-friendly alternative (Ding et al., 2019; Kessner et al., 2023; Mingkwansook et al., 2022). A comparative analysis of images acquired using true non-contrast, deep non-contrast and virtual non-contrast imaging techniques is presented in Figure 3 for the patient.

The patient underwent Left retro sigmoid sub-temporal craniotomy with maximal safe resection of the tumor, with significant improvement in patient symptoms.
Overall, this case report highlights the effectiveness and convenience of using a p-ULF MRI with contrast for detecting and treating brain tumors, with excellent results achieved for our patient.
Discussion
The result of this initial study demonstrates the potential of using pULF-MRI scanners to improve access to neuroimaging in LMICs and facilitate earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of brain tumors. These scanners have the potential to be used in a various setting, such as emergency departments, intensive care units, and remote locations. Use of pULF-MRI is helpful is settings where traditional MRI machines may not be easily available (Sheth et al., 2020). Its potential in identifying brain tumors has already been utilized in the past in a resource-constrained setting (Shakir et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2021). However, this is the first time post-contrast brain tumor imaging has successfully been carried out.
Lesions identified in post-contrast on brain MRI can provide important information about the presence and nature of various brain conditions, including tumors, infections, and infarctions. This is because enhancement occurs when the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted, allowing contrast to leak into the brain tissue (Felix et al., 1985). Tumors that originate from brain cells, such as gliomas, may not always show enhancement if the BBB is intact. Infiltrating tumors like gliomas may have tumor cells beyond the enhancing margins and, therefore, may require additional imaging techniques such as perfusion MRI to assess tumor grade and extent (Belykh et al., 2020). Extra-axial tumors such as meningiomas and schwannomas, as well as non-tumoral lesions like infections, demyelinating diseases (such as multiple sclerosis), and infarctions, can all break down the BBB and show enhancement (Curati et al., 1986; Arnold et al., 2022).
The degree and pattern of enhancement can also provide important diagnostic information. For example, low-grade astrocytomas and cystic non-tumoral lesions typically do not enhance, whereas metastases, lymphoma, germinoma, and other pineal gland tumors, pituitary macroadenoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma (only the solid component) ganglioglioma, meningioma, and schwannoma may show homogeneous or patchy enhancement (Healy et al., 1987; Brant-Zawadzki et al., 1986). Gd-based contrast agents have a short half-life of around 20 min, which means it is quickly eliminated from the body. Hence, in the context of ULF-MRI, the timing of contrast administration is also critical for optimal results. Furthermore, with optimal timing typically occurring around 30 min after administration, it is generally advisable to inject contrast at the start of the examination and perform the enhanced T1WI at the end. The clinician needs to be aware that slight differences in the intensity of contrast enhancement may be related to technical factors such as the method of contrast administration and the exact timing of the scan after the contrast has been injected. Therefore, minor variations in the amount of contrast enhancement may not always imply pathological significance.
Strength and future direction
This study represents the first exploration into the potential and safety profile of pULF-MRI, particularly in the context of post-contrast use for neurosurgery and brain tumor evaluation. We are currently conducting a trial aimed at a side-by-side comparison of pULF-MRI with standard MRI in a cohort of patients, including those with brain tumors. In this ongoing trial, we are assessing the agreement between the two imaging modalities, with blinded neuroradiologists performing tumor analysis. Additionally, we are focusing on the identification of key pathologies such as hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and extradural hematoma, all of which are highly relevant in the context of neurosurgical planning. These next steps will help us further evaluate the diagnostic utility of pULF-MRI to provide additional information to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning to potentially enhance clinical decision-making in neurosurgery in resource limited settings.
Limitations
This study has some limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, only a single dose of gadolinium-based contrast medium was administered for the conventional high-field MRI study.
Another separate dose was not administered for the pULF-MRI scan. Furthermore, the standard dose of gadolinium used for the high-field conventional scan, which might have limited the sensitivity of the scan and hindered more accurate lesion delineation. To improve sensitivity and achieve more accurate results, administering multiple doses of gadolinium and increasing the dosage may be necessary. As such, further research is needed to fully evaluate the effects of these approaches in low-field MRI scans.
In addition to the limitation of contrast dosing, low-field MRI systems face several known challenges, such as lower resolution, longer scan times, and motion artifacts. As highlighted, the image quality of portable MRIs is somewhat inferior to that of larger, high-field strength systems, which makes it more difficult to detect smaller lesions. Despite identifying nearly 94% of lesions when compared to more complex systems, smaller lesions are harder to spot on portable machines. This lower resolution can potentially be improved with longer scan times, but this presents practical challenges, as longer scans may not always be feasible in time-sensitive clinical settings (Altaf et al., 2025).
Moreover, the comparatively lower image quality complicates the tracking of disease progression and treatment effectiveness, which could lead to additional healthcare burdens and costs. The increased scan times required for better resolution may also add to the strain on healthcare resources. Furthermore, motion artifacts are another challenge, as patients must remain still during scans to ensure accurate imaging, which can be particularly difficult for certain patient populations.
These challenges underscore the trade-off between the advantages of portability and affordability and the limitations of image quality.
Conclusion
The use of intravenous (IV) contrast with the pULF-MRI scanner for brain tumor imaging represents a novel application, as this is the first time the effects of IV contrast have been explored with this scanner. While initial findings suggest that IV contrast may enhance diagnostic accuracy and image quality, potentially aiding in the detection, characterization, and treatment planning of brain tumors, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these observations. Given the limited data available, the clinical utility of this approach remains to be fully established. Additionally, careful consideration of the risks and benefits of IV contrast is essential when implementing this technique with the pULF-MRI scanner.

Zhenyu Technology,ZZZ's Belobog Heavy Industries: Is it related to HSR? - ONE Esports,2025-02-10 08:00:00,"Zenless Zone Zero is HoYoverse’s newest video game title but Honkai Star Rail players might notice one tiny overlap: there’s a faction called Belobog Heavy Industries.
Before we get into the meat of it, you should first know some context. ZZZ is an action combat game set in a post-apocalyptic world where strange phenomena known as Hollows appear out of nowhere. Inside these realms, monsters called “Ethereal” wander around.
The surviving city, New Eridu, has thrived by developing technology to extract valuable resources from these Hollows.
As New Eridu becomes a miraculous haven, drawing in more residents, it utilizes extensive exploration of the Hollows for expansion.
The Hollows transform into an industrialized and monetized zone under the city’s control, sparking tensions among monopolies, gangs, conspirators, and fanatics.
One of the factions in the game is called Belobog Heavy Industries, an industrial group in the city.
Fans of Honkai Star Rail, another HoYoverse game, may be familiar with this name since it shares the name of an important place in version 1.0 — Belobog, a city located in Jarilo-VI.
Are these two connected in any way? Curious, we spoke to HoYoverse video game producer Zhenyu Li (李振宇) about this apparent naming coincidence and what it means for ZZZ.
Is Zenless Zone Zero related to Honkai Star Rail? HoYoverse producer sheds light on Belobog Heavy Industries’ name
Zhenyu has clarified with ONE Esports that Zenless Zone Zero’s universe is not, in any way, related to Honkai.
“After the release of the second beta test trailer, many players noticed that a core faction in the game is named Belobog Heavy Industries, which overlaps with the name of an important element in another game,” the video game producer told ONE Esports. “However, this is merely a coincidence, and there is no direct connection between the two.”
In ZZZ, Belobog Heavy Industries is a newly emerging industrial group whose main business covers infrastructure and construction machinery.
Led by the ambitious Koleda, the President of Belobog Heavy Industries, this faction is no stranger to the Hollows. They have a patent for “specialized heavy machinery for work within Hollows” and have a group of employees who are certified Hollow Investigators.
“I don’t want to give away too much, but I hope that players can learn more about the story of Belobog Heavy Industries in the second beta test,” Zhenyu said.
While ZZZ and HSR have no direct ties when it comes to their respective lores, Zhenyu isn’t closing their doors on a future collaboration.
“The world of ZZZ stands apart from other games, offering a unique and independent experience,” Zhenyu said. “The current version does not feature any crossover content with other games. However, I see this as an open possibility in the future.”
Zenless Zone Zero launches globally on July 4, 2024 on iOS, Android, PC, and PlayStation 5.

Montage Technology,Macron's deepfakes raise questions over AI use - BBC,2025-02-10 08:00:00,"Macron shares his deepfakes for AI summit attention
French President Emmanuel Macron has used AI-generated deepfake videos to publicise the start of the AI Action Summit taking place in Paris.
In a video posted on his social media accounts, Macron reacts to a montage of deepfaked videos of himself in popular films and TV series by saying ""nicely done"".
Videos of Macron inserted into popular media, using AI, have been circulating on French social media for the past few months.
In October, he told Variety that deepfakes ""can be a form of harassment"" for some people.
Some experts have questioned the use of the deepfakes, saying normalising them makes it harder to spot fake news.
The montage of deepfakes, which has been seen millions of times across the president's Instagram, X and TikTok accounts, shows him inserted into a 1980s euro disco hit, an influencer's hair tutorial and the action hero TV show MacGyver.
Videos such as these have been popular of French social media for a while, so this is Macron acknowledging that he has become a meme among some social media circles.
Then the real Macron says: ""It's pretty well done, it made me laugh.""
""But more seriously, with artificial intelligence, we can do some very big things: change healthcare, energy, life in our society,"" the 47-year-old president said.
He adds: ""France and Europe must be at the heart of this revolution to seize every opportunity and also to promote our own principles.""
The video was posted ahead of a two-day global AI summit starting in Paris on Monday.
The aim of the summit is to unite world leaders, tech executives, and academics to examine AI's impact on society, governance, and the environment.
""President Macron's deepfake might seem like harmless fun to promote the AI Summit in Paris, but it is not in general a good thing,"" says Paul McKay, principal analyst at technology consultancy Forrester.
""Normalising deepfakes in this way should not be encouraged as it continues the difficulty with telling what is real and what isn't, and is ultimately helping to establish what is fact from fiction.""
Dr Richard Whittle from Salford Business School also warns of the risk of ""normalising"" deepfakes videos, ""both on social media and by scammers"".
He adds: ""It is great to bring attention to this threat, but doing it in a way that shows how easy it is to create deepfakes risks their wider adoption.""
Prof Philip Howard, president of the International Panel on the Information Environment, says AI is increasingly being used ""in innovative, sometimes playful ways, as demonstrated by President Macron's recent video.""
But he adds: ""These kinds of videos are often released when the guidelines on public communication are not clear.""
There has been some debate in the French media over whether Macron should be trivialising deepfake videos when they can be used for harm.
In October, Macron told Variety deepfakes ""can disinform, which can upset our democracies"".
He said they should be regulated ""by imposing responsibility on the people who disseminate this content to moderate it"".
The EU's newly implemented AI Act, which regulates the use of artificial intelligence, has faced criticism at the Summit for stifling innovation.
The bloc also unveiled plans for a Europe-wide, open source AI model with a budget of €37.4m (£31.1m).
A global declaration of shared AI goals and ethical responsibilities is due to be revealed at the end of the Summit tomorrow.

Chinasoft International,America’s Soft-Power Retreat - The New Yorker,2025-02-07 08:00:00,"Last year, the Africa Cup of Nations, the continent’s biggest international soccer tournament, kicked off in Côte d’Ivoire, in a stadium designed, financed, and built by China. This should not come as a surprise to anyone who follows the sport, nor is it some new development. The first Chinese-made stadium in Africa was completed more than fifty years ago. By the end of the millennium, nine more African countries would open their capital cities to what came to be known as “stadium diplomacy.” The quantity and scale of these stadiums grew alongside an increasingly robust push to quickly build infrastructure in poor African countries. The soccer historian David Goldblatt writes:
In the 1980s, China had been content to foster solidarity in Africa and leverage it to diplomatically exclude and isolate Taiwan. After assessing the post-Cold War landscape in the early 1990s, however, it became clear to the Chinese leadership that Africa offered rather more. China’s burgeoning industrial economy and population would soon require new export markets, land for agricultural purposes and, above all, access to the full range of raw materials its factories consumed. Africa, particularly as its oil reserves grew, offered all of these in abundance and, given the United States’ rapid withdrawal from the continent after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the price of entry looked very low.
Stadium diplomacy has had its problems. Some of the structures have been set up in inconvenient locations. There’s also reportedly very little follow-up from the Chinese, who mostly seem content to drop a big stadium in an African city and let the local government figure out what to do with it. In some cases, stadiums constructed less than twenty years ago have already been effectively abandoned. But from a foreign-policy perspective, China’s investment has more than paid off. Soft power, in many ways, is an economy of symbols. You get a foothold in some wildly public spectacle, throw some money at it, and then hope that the masses conclude that you’re not so bad.
President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, through the first two weeks of their Administration, have unleashed a series of executive orders and purges of the federal budget that may very well benefit China and its seemingly unrelenting appetite for soft power. U.S.A.I.D., the international-development organization that helps to advance American interests abroad, has become Musk’s most recent focus. This is a bit strange given that foreign assistance comprises less than one per cent of the total federal budget. A management consultant who comes into a company to radically slash waste probably shouldn’t get caught up for weeks on the water bubblers in the lounge, but Musk seems fully committed to razing U.S.A.I.D. and salting the earth beneath it. One can speculate why this has happened. Perhaps Musk has been told that he can’t actually overrun the entire federal government and has committed himself to thoroughly dismantling a relatively small program so he doesn’t look weak. Or maybe he just really hates the idea of helping people in other countries, regardless of how it might help American interests. But, if you follow the accepted logic of soft power, all of Musk’s gleeful cutting could very well open up opportunities for China to fill the void that U.S.A.I.D. leaves behind.
But do Americans still care about competition with China? Do appeals to American soft power still resonate with the electorate? At first glance, it appears that they do. A Pew Research poll from last year found that about eighty per cent of older Americans have an unfavorable view of China, a number that has steadily risen since the start of Trump’s first term in office. In 2017, sentiment was more or less evenly split, with forty-seven per cent of respondents saying they had an unfavorable view and forty-three per cent saying they had a favorable view. Last year, a poll from the Chicago Council of Global Affairs found that fifty-five per cent of Americans said the “United States should actively work to limit the growth of China’s power,” and fifty-six per cent believed trade between the United States and China weakened national security. Some of this can be attributed to the pandemic, but the negative swings in sentiment started years before COVID-19 started spreading out of Wuhan.
Given these numbers, one would expect both Republicans and Democrats to be rattling their sabres at China. During the first Trump Administration, the gutting of U.S.A.I.D. would have been accompanied by endless recriminations from hawkish liberals about the imminent end of democracy in the developing Global South and the coming of a Chinese hegemonic superpower that would extract every mineral from the earth and use whatever energy they produced to violate the human rights of every inhabitant in their new colony. But there has been little talk about China at all from the Democrats. Trump has implemented a ten-per-cent tariff on China, which, it should be noted, is significantly lower than the tariffs he dangled in front of Mexico and Canada. His tone with President Xi Jinping and our supposed Cold War nemeses has been relatively dovish.
Of all the elected officials in Washington, Tom Cotton seems most committed to Cold War rhetoric—he and two fellow-senators recently reintroduced legislation that would bar any Chinese individual or business from owning land in the U.S. Cotton’s most notable recent appearance in the public eye came when he questioned TikTok’s C.E.O., Shou Zi Chew, as part of a congressional hearing. In a viral clip, which was mocked by everyone from John Oliver to video-game streamers, Cotton kept asking Chew if he was a Chinese citizen or if he was affiliated with the C.C.P., and Chew, who is Singaporean, kept reminding Cotton that China and Singapore are not the same country. Cotton’s hawkishness and his career, over all, feel almost anachronistic at this point, a relic from 2020 when everyone was looking around for Trump’s successor, not realizing the king was just taking a nap.
China talk, of course, is not relegated to one side of the aisle: on Tuesday, David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist who made his name during the Obama Administration, appeared on CNN to comment on Trump’s still hazy, but certainly startling, plan to “take over” the Gaza Strip. “Imagine how the Chinese interpret that as they eye Taiwan,” Axelrod said. The point, while fair enough, also felt antiquated and from a different time when the war, in itself, would not be enough of a political story, and when we all believed we were on the brink of armed conflict with China. Does any American citizen, upon hearing Trump’s plan for Gaza, turn their thoughts to what China must be thinking about all this? The Cold War almost feels like a rhetorical gesture—something people say when they need to tack on reasons why their political opponents have messed up, once again.
Last year, I wrote that the now paused ban on TikTok represented a serious threat to civil liberties and free speech. Echoing the logic of Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, I argued that Americans have the right to receive propaganda, even if the propaganda might not paint this country in a particularly favorable light. Concerns about stolen data felt mostly beside the point—almost all of our data can already be purchased cheaply on open markets, which means that China, having created a sprawling data-stealing video algorithm that happened to captivate the world, would probably be better off just shutting down the data-stealing part and focussing on its new creation. It’s like in Woody Allen’s “Small Time Crooks,” where a character played by Tracey Ullman starts a cookie bakery so that her husband can use the store's wall to access and rob a bank. The cookie shop takes off, making them fabulously wealthy, which ends the need to rob the bank.
But that doesn’t mean that the millions of hours Americans have consumed on TikTok have had zero influence on how they feel about the world, and China, in particular. TikTok gave millions of Americans a look into a China filled with friendly, English-speaking tour guides in bustling and architecturally fascinating cities like Chongqing; charming, hard-drinking farmers in verdant countrysides; hilarious lighted-sign salesmen; and fun, relatable groups of friends who got dressed up for hot-pot dinners. During the very short time that TikTok went offline in America, thousands of former users went over to RedNote, a Chinese TikTok alternative, where meme-happy Chinese netizens introduced themselves and their country to the flood of American digital refugees. This cute cultural exchange was short-lived and had no real lasting effects, but TikTok probably did quietly change the attitudes of millions of Americans toward their purported enemy. The most effective propaganda China could produce was extremely normal and mundane portraits of daily life. TikTok took away the illusion that many Americans had about polluted skies, legions of militarized police, and slave-like working conditions. It made China look normal, even occasionally cool.
TikTok, perhaps by accident, became a form of stadium diplomacy. Give Americans the algorithm and audience dynamics they want, and they’ll eventually conclude you can’t be that bad. It’s difficult to know whether any of this was intentional, but the over-all public sentiment about China doesn’t seem in line with the increasingly distant calls for alarm. When DeepSeek, a Chinese A.I. company, released a new model that could complete the same tasks as American A.I. firms, but at a fraction of the computing cost, several leading members of the tech industry, including the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, called it a “Sputnik moment” that signalled the U.S. was now in an A.I. arms race with China. The response from much of the public was mostly bemusement. (It certainly wasn’t a rallying of support to Silicon Valley or companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to win the race to artificial general intelligence.) Much like with the TikTok ban, the demand, instead, seemed to be, “Just give us the cool app. China already has our data.”
One of the most shared and discussed ideas from the previous election season came from the economist Tyler Cowen’s blog. Cowen was trying to make sense of why public sentiment had swung toward Trump and listed off a number of reasons why this “vibe shift” had taken place. Similarly, we might be in the early phases of a vibe shift when it comes to America’s relationship with China. Hawkishness and our own forms of stadium diplomacy, regardless of whether the programs are helpful or not, are clearly no longer priorities. Trump and Musk probably have a variety of reasons for going after U.S.A.I.D., but I imagine part of it comes from the fact that most Americans aren’t particularly interested in diplomatic aid programs or the geopolitical implications of withdrawal from the international stage. Trump, at least for now, seems to agree. And, though he and Musk have likely squandered whatever good will they might have had after the election and Inauguration, the decision to mostly withdraw from the anti-China Cold War rhetoric of the Biden Administration might accurately reflect the will of the electorate. Let China build their stadiums abroad, they seem to be saying. We have our own problems here. There is an implicit capitulation in all this, one that might be reflected in the dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. Americans may be waking up to what has been quite obvious until now, but difficult to admit: this Cold War has only one protagonist and it isn’t us. ♦","[{'head': 'China', 'relation': 'invested_in', 'subtype': 'infrastructure_development', 'tail': ""stadium in Côte d'Ivoire""}, {'head': 'Elon Musk', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'focus_on', 'tail': 'U.S.A.I.D.'}, {'head': 'U.S.A.I.D.', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'relation_to', 'tail': 'Elon Musk'}]","['tyler cowen’s', 'the u.s. cotton’s', 'the biden administration', 'jameel jaffer', 'covid-19', 'trump', 'côte', 'axelrod', 'the knight first amendment institute', 'cnn', 'cotton', 'elon musk', 'marc andreessen', 'pew research', 'trump administration', 'john oliver', 'david goldblatt', 'the chicago council of global affairs', 'xi jinping', 'columbia university', 'david axelrod', 'woody allen’s', 'rednote', 'donald trump', 'a.i.', 'musk', 'c.c.p.', 'tracey ullman', 'tom cotton', 'soft-power retreat - the new yorker', 'tiktok', 'inauguration']","- The Africa Cup of Nations in Côte d’Ivoire was held in a Chinese-built stadium, highlighting China's long-standing ""stadium diplomacy"" in Africa, which dates back over fifty years.

MooMoo,Wealthsimple Canada launches margin trading for CAD stock investors - Good Money Guide,2025-02-07 08:00:00,"Wealthsimple has launched margin trading for qualified Canadian stock traders.
The Canada-based stock broker – which is currently only available to residents of the country – has introduced three tiers of prime rates for margin accounts, depending on how much in assets they hold.
Margin trading at Wealthsimple involves borrowing money, with the value of an investor’s portfolio used as collateral, with interest charged on the amount borrowed. It can boost the returns of profitable trades, and also magnifies losses.
Wealthsimple’s new margin account carries different prime interest rates depending on the currency held in the account. Its website claims they are “lower than at any Canadian bank”.
For Canadian Dollars (CAD), these are currently 5.7% for amounts between $1 and $100,000, 5.2% for amounts between $100,000 and $500,000, and 4.75% above $500,00.
For US Dollars (USD), the rates are 8% between $1 and $100,000, 7.5% between $100,000 and $500,000 and 7% above $500,000.
Wealthsimple also has an additional charge or discount on these prime rate depending on their plan with the firm.
For “Core” customers hold between CAD $1 and $100,000 with the platform, it charges 0.5% on top of the prime rates above.
For Premium customers which have between $100,000 and $500,000 in assets, there is no extra charge.
For Generation customers who have more than $500,000 in assets with the platform, there is a discount of 0.5% on the prime rates.
The firm is currently offering 1% cash bonus or match, on transfers to its margin account between $15,000 and $5,000,000 in value.
As of November last year, Wealthsimple had more than three million users across Canada and hosted more than CAD $50 billion in assets.
Last year, rival Robinhood made margin trading available for users in the UK. The popular US investment app currently charges margin rates of between 4.7% and 5.75%, tiered according to account balance.
Robin has more than six years of experience as a financial journalist, most of which were spent at Citywire, and covers the latest developments in the investing, trading and currency transfer space. Outside of work, he enjoys reading literature and philosophy and playing the piano.

Source：Getty Images
China has strategically prioritized enhancing its soft power, a concept introduced by Joseph Nye that emphasizes influence through cultural appeal rather than coercion. This approach involves promoting Chinese cultural products globally and aligning foreign cultural narratives with the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). How effective is this strategy in altering global geopolitical narratives?

China’s Soft Power Propaganda Network
By IJ Reportikaweb only
China’s efforts to bolster its soft power have been a focal point of its foreign policy for years. Soft power, a term coined by Joseph Nye, refers to the ability of a country to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction rather than coercion or payment. For China, this means influencing global culture both through the production and export of its cultural products and by molding foreign cultural productions to align with the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) interests. This report delves into the export of Chinese cultural products designed to influence foreign audience and entice them with its geopolitical narrative.
Soft Power Propaganda Network
By the end of 2023, China had subscribers to cable television programs numbered 202 million, with 193 million subscribing to digital cable television. Radio and television broadcasting coverage rates were 99.7 percent and 99.8 percent, respectively. In 2023, China produced 4,632 episodes of 156 TV series and 93,811 minutes of TV cartoons, along with 792 feature movies and 179 popular science movies, documentaries, animations, and special movies. The country issued 25.8 billion copies of newspapers, 1.8 billion copies of magazines, and published 11.9 billion copies of books, averaging 8.40 books per person. Additionally, there were millions of big and small YouTube channels, TikTok Handles and other Social Media Influence Handles that contributed to the Soft Power Propaganda Network of China.
The Strategic Vision
China’s pursuit of soft power is deeply rooted in its strategic vision to establish itself as a central player on the global stage. At the 19th CCP National Congress, President Xi Jinping underscored the significance of culture as the soul of a nation, emphasizing that the strength of a nation is intrinsically linked to its cultural vitality. Xi’s speech highlighted the resilience of Chinese culture, forged through a history marked by struggle and sacrifice, and framed this cultural legacy as a cornerstone of China’s global influence. He proclaimed that the world is now witnessing a real, multi-dimensional, and comprehensive image of China, signaling a clear intention to project a favorable and controlled narrative of Chinese identity and power.
This vision is not new but builds on a foundation laid by Xi’s predecessors. Since 2006, China has systematically developed its cultural strategy through successive five-year plans, focusing on the production and export of Chinese cultural products as a means to enhance its soft power. President Hu Jintao, at the 17th Communist Party Congress in 2007, committed China to integrating soft power into its foreign policy, emphasizing a narrative of peaceful rise. Xi Jinping, however, has taken a more assertive approach, explicitly reinforcing the need to increase China’s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative, and better communicate China’s message to the world. This directive reflects a shift towards a more ethnocentric form of soft power, rooted in Chinese history, heritage, and socialist values.
Xi’s articulation of cultural soft power (文化软实力) focuses on promoting the virtues of Chinese traditions and the nation’s rich historical legacy. By shaping and controlling the narrative around its cultural identity, China aims to strengthen its influence and ensure that its rise is viewed in a positive light. This strategic vision, while deeply rooted in Chinese cultural pride, represents a complex and evolving approach to soft power that blends traditional values with modern geopolitical aspirations.
Exporting Cultural Products
Cultural products, such as movies, TV series, music, YouTube channels, and social media influence handles, serve as potent instruments of influence, especially when they penetrate foreign markets and resonate with local tastes. Among these, movies and TV series stand out as particularly powerful and attractive vectors. China’s strategic investment in the export of its cultural products is evident in the rapid growth of its entertainment industry, which has increasingly become a key element of its soft power approach.
In 2021, China reported the highest box office revenue globally, totaling approximately $7.3 billion. This figure surpasses the combined revenues of the United States, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom, making China the top film market in the world. The surge in China’s box office revenue reflects not only the success of its domestic film industry but also the nation’s broader cultural influence. The Chinese movie industry has flourished over the past few decades, mirroring the country’s overall economic expansion.
As part of this growth, China has seen a dramatic increase in the number of cinema screens. In 2023, China boasted over 86,000 cinema screens, making it one of the countries with the highest number of cinema screens worldwide. This rapid expansion is largely driven by China’s growing urban population and rising demand for entertainment. In 2021 alone, the country built nearly 1,000 new cinemas, demonstrating its commitment to cultivating a vibrant film culture.
The proliferation of cinema screens has been accompanied by a significant rise in movie ticket sales, which surpassed the one billion mark in 2015 and continued to expand until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth is fueled by the increasing disposable income among Chinese citizens, further boosting box office sales. The robust development of China’s film industry underscores the nation’s strategic use of cultural products to enhance its global influence, reinforcing its soft power ambitions on the world stage.
Key Organizations
Several organizations are central to marketing and promoting Chinese cultural products abroad, each playing a unique role in shaping global perceptions of China:
1. China International Television Corporation (CITVC): Established in 1984 as a subsidiary of China Media Group (CMG), CITVC focuses on promoting Chinese television products internationally. Through partnerships with foreign channels, such as the China Hour on Portugal’s Porto Canal, CITVC has successfully introduced Chinese programming to Southern European audiences.
2. China Radio, Film and Television Programs Exchanging Center (CHNPEC): Overseeing the global marketing and promotion of Chinese films and TV series, CHNPEC operates under the supervision of CMG and CITVC. This organization plays a pivotal role in increasing the international presence of Chinese media content.
3. China International Film and TV Programs Exhibition (CIFTPE): An annual event dedicated to showcasing Chinese films and television programs for export. CIFTPE serves as a platform for international cooperation, allowing Chinese content creators to engage with global markets.
4. Film and TV Import and Export Association (FTIEA): Created in 2017, FTIEA promotes Chinese film and television productions through participation in international forums and events, facilitating the exchange and distribution of Chinese media content abroad.
5. Belt and Road Media Community (BRMC): As part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the BRMC fosters media and cultural cooperation among countries within the BRI framework. This initiative aims to strengthen ties between China and participating nations through shared media and cultural content.
6. Central Propaganda Department (CPD): The Central Propaganda Department, also known as the CCP’s Propaganda Department, is the primary body responsible for ideological control, media censorship, and the dissemination of propaganda. It oversees all forms of media, including newspapers, television, online platforms, and social media, ensuring they align with the party’s policies and narratives. The CPD plays a critical role in controlling information flow, guiding public opinion, and reinforcing the CCP’s ideological dominance.
These organizations are instrumental in advancing China’s soft power propaganda network, ensuring that Chinese films, television programs, and other cultural products are accessible and appealing to international audiences while subtly reinforcing the CCP’s geopolitical narrative.
Conclusion
The investigation into China’s Soft Power Propaganda Network or Chinese International Propaganda Network reveals a sophisticated and multifaceted approach to influencing global perceptions. By leveraging cultural products, cinema, and media, China has effectively utilized soft power as a tool to shape narratives and promote a positive image internationally. The strategic vision behind this network is clear: to bolster China’s global influence by exporting cultural products that reflect its values, achievements, and perspectives.
Chinese cinema has played a pivotal role in this strategy, with state-sponsored films like The Founding of a Republic and Wolf Warrior 2 portraying a strong, unified China that stands as a global power. These films, alongside others such as The Wandering Earth and My People, My Country, emphasize themes of nationalism, unity, and China’s role on the world stage, resonating with both domestic and international audiences. Moreover, the influence extends beyond Chinese borders, as China seeks to assert its soft power by co-opting Hollywood and other global movie industries through censorship, content manipulation, and strategic investments.
The case studies on the Chinese diaspora and the portrayal of sensitive regions like Tibet and Xinjiang further illustrate the depth of China’s propaganda efforts. By controlling the narrative through films, TV series, and digital platforms, China effectively shapes global discourse, ensuring that its version of history and current events is widely disseminated.
Overall, China’s Soft Power Propaganda Network is a testament to the country’s ability to harness the power of culture, media, and technology to project a carefully curated image of itself to the world. This network not only influences how China is perceived globally but also reflects the country’s broader geopolitical ambitions. As China’s influence continues to grow, understanding the mechanisms and strategies behind its soft power becomes increasingly critical for global observers and policymakers.

Montage Technology,Why the markets are freaking out about Chinese AI newcomer DeepSeek - Ars Technica,2025-01-28 08:00:00,"A Chinese company’s claim of a $5.6 million artificial intelligence breakthrough wiped almost $600 billion from Nvidia’s market value on Monday, shattering Wall Street’s confidence that tech companies’ AI spending spree will continue and dealing an apparent blow to US tech leadership.
Yet many in Silicon Valley believe the broad sell-off is an overreaction to DeepSeek’s latest model, which they argue could spur wider adoption and utility of AI by radically lowering the technology’s cost, sustaining demand for Nvidia’s chips.
Pat Gelsinger, recently forced out as chief executive of Intel, was among those buying his former rival Nvidia’s stock on Monday. “The market reaction is wrong: lowering the cost of AI will expand the market,” he said in a LinkedIn post. “DeepSeek is an incredible piece of engineering that will usher in greater adoption of AI.”
Nvidia became the world’s most valuable company last year as investors bet on Big Tech companies’ insatiable appetite for its powerful AI processors. The chipmaker’s chief executive Jensen Huang has predicted $1 trillion worth of AI data centers will be built in the next few years.
Underpinning that confidence was the concept of an AI “scaling law,” popularized by senior leaders at AI start-ups such as OpenAI and Anthropic, that suggested AI models got smarter as they were fed more data and computing resources.
DeepSeek’s release of its highly capable R1 model—and the research paper explaining openly how it was made—seemed to break the scaling law’s spell, as its chatbot leapt to the top of the iPhone’s US App Store chart over the weekend. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index shed 9.2 percent, its worst daily drop since March 2020.","[{'head': 'Nvidia', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'CEO', 'tail': 'Jensen Huang'}, {'head': 'Intel', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'former CEO', 'tail': 'Pat Gelsinger'}]","['philadelphia semiconductor', 'big tech', 'ai', 'r1', 'jensen huang', 'linkedin', 'pat gelsinger', 'nvidia', 'intel', 'deepseek']","- A Chinese company, DeepSeek, announced a $5.6 million AI breakthrough, leading to a $600 billion loss in Nvidia's market value on Monday.

MooMoo,Moomoo's Inaugural North America 2024 Investor Survey: A steady climb in the 2024 markets boosted investor confidence; Canada investors more concerned about tax and currency volatility - PR Newswire,2025-01-27 08:00:00,"JERSEY CITY, N.J., Jan. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Moomoo, one of the world's leading investment and trading platforms has recently completed its first North American user survey, revealing that the steady climb in the 2024 markets has significantly bolstered investor confidence. Moomoo users in both the US and Canada report to have traded more often in 2024 than in 2023 and the number of users reporting positive returns also grew. Looking forward to 2025, most investors still expect that tech stocks to lead the way despite a recent slowdown in their market leadership.
With the US market near all-time highs, overall investors are less worried about inflation and the economy and have slightly tempered their bullish views on markets due to higher valuations. Support from the Fed in the form of interest rate cuts is expected by surveyed users, but not at the pace of 2024. Moomoo's users in Canada are generally aware of and increasingly well prepared to face the unique investing challenges around taxes, exchange rates and central bank policy.
As the markets notched a second consecutive year of over 20% price appreciation with stronger-than-expected economic and earnings growth and interest cuts by the Federal Reserve, 75% of moomoo users report to have traded more than they did in 2023 as investors look at the stock market more positively and confidently. However, the forward-looking perspective is not as rosy as last year as 42% of surveyed users are bullish for 2025 compared to 45% at the beginning of 2024. Higher valuations may be one of the reasons for the more neutral outlook from survey participants. 64% of user said the stocks at the center of the AI revolution are overvalued compared with 54% a year ago.
""While many investors took charge of their trading and rode the market highs in 2024, they expect technology stocks to overperform the rest of the market with some caution of its overvaluation,"" said Justin Zacks, Vice President of Strategy, Moomoo Technologies Inc. That explains why 85% of users added money to their moomoo trading accounts in 2024. Also, two thirds of users who added money to their account did so three or more times in 2024.
Moomoo's US CEO Neil McDonald added, ""We learned that 31% of our users are very confident in meeting their investment goals compared to 26% a year earlier. However, in 2025, while the general economic picture matters to moomoo investors, inflation worries eased, but a softening job market might lead investors into a cautious positive sentiment.""
For moomoo Canadian users, 87% of them consider taxes to be a very or somewhat important part of their investment strategy and 88% of Canadian users are either very or somewhat concerned about the impact of currency exchange rates on their US investments.
""As the Canadian dollar ended the year at its weakest level against the US dollar since 2002, potential changes in tariffs in 2025 may cause further currency volatility,"" said Michael Arbus, CEO at Moomoo Financial Canada. ""Moomoo Canada users who trade US stocks, options and ETFs will take the currency factor into majority of their investment approach.""

Chinasoft International,My Take | China’s soft power moment has arrived with RedNote’s unexpected global success - South China Morning Post,2025-01-24 08:00:00,"My Take | China’s soft power moment has arrived with RedNote’s unexpected global success
The millions of new users who flocked to RedNote ahead of the TikTok ban show that China’s soft power can come in different forms
A recent wave of TikTok users flocking to the RedNote app could finally be China’s grand moment to showcase its soft power credentials, even as Beijing officials have been caught off guard by the development.
RedNote’s unexpected global success provides an invaluable lesson to Chinese policymakers – that soft power can emerge spontaneously rather than projected through assiduously planned official campaigns.
Earlier this month, ahead of the impending US ban on TikTok, millions of American users of the short-form video app decamped to RedNote, the rival Chinese social media platform also known as Xiaohongshu. In just one day, the number of US iPhone users with RedNote accounts surged from about 400,000 to 1.8 million, according to analytics firm Similarweb, and this number has since risen further.
Calling themselves “TikTok refugees”, these users downloaded the Chinese app in the same week that TikTok was expected to go offline, making RedNote the No.1 free-to-use app in the US Apple app store. These users have gained a reprieve after US President Donald Trump issued an order on Monday to delay the app’s ban.
The boon from RedNote comes after China has been seeking for years to boost its soft power, a term popularised by American political scientist Joseph Nye and defined by him as a country’s ability to influence others without the use of coercive pressure.
During the 17th Communist Party Congress in 2007, former Chinese leader Hu Jintao committed China to using soft power as an extension of foreign policy.",[],"['communist party congress', 'rednote', 'donald trump', 'similarweb', 'xiaohongshu', 'tiktok', 'joseph nye', 'hu jintao']","- RedNote, a Chinese social media app, saw a surge in American users, growing from 400,000 to 1.8 million in one day, due to concerns over a potential TikTok ban.

MooMoo,"Hey Moo Moos cafe closes, as hospo entrepreneur sets sights on wedding and events industry - Glam Adelaide",2025-01-22 08:00:00,"A popular suburban cafe has announced that it has closed its doors after opening only five months ago.
Hey MooMoo’s was the latest project by young entrepreneur Elliott Brown and business partner Mitchell Ward, who back in August of last year, added Hey MooMoo’s to a lineup of successful cafes spearheaded by Elliott.
“The main reason we’ve had to shut our doors is because of difficulties with the landlord,” Elliott shared.
“I had a lot of ideas for what the space needed and what we wanted to do with the courtyard. It’s a very bustling area and super busy, filled with families, the playground desperately needed to be redone. I tried to put in outdoor furniture, and things like that but we couldn’t seem to come to an agreement.”
Elliott, who is also involved with McLaren Vale’s ‘Hey Juj’ and Henley Beach’s ‘Hey Zozo’s’, and now ‘MASE Events’ has had a successful run in the Adelaide hospitality scene opening all three of his cafes within nine months of each other.
“Since closing I love that people have been reaching out, saying they’ve been sad to see a local coffee shop go. I’ve definitely had a lot of support from people in the local area and from our other shop ‘Hey Juj’ wanting to help and support. Everyone has been really good about reaching out and offering their support.
“Recently I did acquire MASE Events which is a very busy event hire and styling business, so now I’m excited to move my focus towards that.
“I have had a lot of people reach out going ‘Would you like to open a shop here or a place here’ but to be honest right now we’re in peak wedding season so I need to spend my time focusing on MASE. Maybe down the track, who knows something else might pop up, but right now that’s where my focus will be.”
Elliott shares that there’s still heaps to come at his other venues and people should look out for their once-monthly disco night at Hey Juj.
“We do this disco, night club vibe once a month at Hey Juj. It’s been popping off really well, I think we’ll now have to get a door list going because it’s becoming so popular,” he shared.
The closure of Hey MooMoo’s may mark the end of one chapter for Elliott Brown, but with the continued success of his other cafés and the growing demand for MASE Events, his entrepreneurial journey is far from over.

Sirio Pharma,"China’s Sirio Pharma beefs up SEA presence with new Thai plant, Singapore office - NutraIngredients-Asia.com",2025-01-21 08:00:00,"The contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO) is set to build a nutraceutical production site in Chonburi, east of Thailand.
Aside from gummies, the production plant will also come with automatic packaging lines.
Sirio Pharma’s board has approved a potential total investment of up to US$40m for the project - which is currently pending review and approval from both Thai and Chinese regulators.
Once approved, it will be Sirio Pharma’s first Asian production plant built outside of China.
The company will also open a new office in Singapore’s central business district at 6 Battery Road later this month, as part of its efforts in increasing regional customer and trade association partnering.
Responding to queries from NutraIngredients-Asia, Alex Du, general manager, Asia Pacific BU said that the site would primarily cater to regional customers across Southeast Asia, although it would also be available for global supply.
The decision to build production site in Thailand is based on “strong growth” coming out of the region.
The company declined to disclose its year-on-year sales growth from SEA, but said that the business saw its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2022 and 2024 exceed 100 per cent.
“We have seen strong growth all across the SEA region and this new facility will give our customers additional flexibility for local manufacturing,” said Du.
New brand launches, increased consumer uptake to drive SEA growth
Sirio Pharma is expecting to see sustained growth in SEA due to the launch of newer brands in the region.
Additionally, e-commerce and social media have led to increased use of nutraceuticals among younger consumers, said Du.
The Chonburi site will be the company’s eighth production site worldwide.
“In fact, as a nutraceutical CDMOs, one of our unique advantages is that we have multiple sites in three continents. This is our first plant in APAC outside of China,” said Du.
The company also has two production sites in the US, one in Europe, and four in China - including Ma’anshan in Anhui.
In 2022, Sirio Pharma also acquired 80 per cent equity of US’s nutraceutical contract manufacturer Best Formulations.
Gummy sensory requirements
According to the company, it is seeing an increased demand globally for higher quality gummy products.
This would cut across taste, texture, appearance requirements.
“Globally we are seeing increased demand in all markets for higher quality gummy products and nutraceuticals with proven shelf life and excellent organoleptic properties.
“The end consumer now wants best in class nutraceuticals with excellent taste, texture and appearance as well as quality ingredients,” said Du.","[{'head': 'Sirio Pharma', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'acquisition', 'tail': 'Best Formulations'}, {'head': 'Sirio Pharma', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'general_manager', 'tail': 'Alex Du'}]","['apac', 'sirio pharma', 'best formulations', 'alex du', 'nutraingredients-asia', 'sea', 'sirio pharma’s', 'du', 'asia pacific bu']","- Sirio Pharma plans to invest up to $40 million in a nutraceutical production facility in Chonburi, Thailand, pending regulatory approval.

SMI Semiconductor,Delays in TSMC’s Arizona plant spark supply chain worries - cio.com,2025-01-21 08:00:00,"Major tech firms may have to remain dependent on Taiwan-based plants, increasing their exposure to geopolitical risks. Credit: Shutterstock/Wirestock Creators Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has said it is unlikely to equip its new US plant in Arizona with its most advanced chip technology ahead of its Taiwan factories, raising concerns about supply-chain hurdles for tech companies. Speaking at a university event in Taiwan, TSMC CEO and Chairman C.C. Wei attributed the delays at TSMC’s Arizona factory to a combination of complex compliance requirements, local construction regulations, and extensive permitting processes, according to a Reuters report. Wei explained that each stage of construction requires permits, with approval timelines taking at least twice as long as in Taiwan, creating challenges in deploying the company’s most advanced chip technology. Additional obstacles, Wei said, include supply chain disruptions and a lack of established regulations for chip plant construction in the US, which have further hindered progress.Wei also noted that chemical supply costs in the US are substantially higher, citing the need to ship sulfuric acid from Taiwan to Los Angeles and then transport it to Arizona by truck. Despite these setbacks and increased costs, Wei expressed optimism during the company’s recent earnings call, assuring that the Arizona plant would meet the same quality standards as its facilities in Taiwan and forecasting a smooth production ramp-up. The US government has extended robust support to TSMC’s investment, offering a $6.6 billion grant through CHIPS and Science Act to lessen dependence on Asia for semiconductor manufacturing and address geographic vulnerabilities in the global chip supply chain. TSMC’s challenges in the US Analysts point out that the US regulatory environment is more complex than Taiwan’s, leading to longer timelines and higher costs for TSMC’s Arizona project. “Unlike Taiwan’s streamlined regulations, the US has a sequential, multi-layered approval process, including stringent construction, environmental, and safety codes that necessitate adjustments,” said Manish Rawat, semiconductor analyst at TechInsights. “Supply chain constraints, such as higher material costs and logistical challenges, further increase expenses.” Taiwan holds over $100 billion in assets and decades of experience in semiconductor manufacturing, while the US is still catching up in terms of resources and governance needed to recreate the infrastructure required to support production, said Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst at Amalgam Insights. The shortage of a skilled semiconductor manufacturing workforce in the US necessitates importing talent, driving up costs for training and relocation. TSMC said last year that its first Arizona fab was on schedule to begin producing chips using 4nm technology in the first half of 2025. Reports now indicate production has already started. Two additional plants are planned for the coming years, but the ongoing challenges could lead to further delays in their completion. “Although the first Arizona TSMC factory has been brought into production, the other two fab plants are not scheduled to start working until 2028 and 2030, respectively,” Park said. “Delays in accessing modern technology may postpone those launch dates.” Impact on supply chain Delays in implementing TSMC’s latest chip technology at its US facility could impact the supply chain for major American tech firms such as Apple and Nvidia, though analysts believe the effects may become more apparent next year. “TSMC has already made a commitment to support both N2 and A16 production in Arizona for next-gen chips,” said Park. “TSMC capacity is pretty much committed through 2025 already, so new technology delays are more relevant for the upcoming 2 nm and 1.6 nm chips expected to be more prevalent next year.” Delays at TSMC’s Arizona plant could compel its customers to rely on Taiwan-based facilities, leaving them vulnerable to geopolitical risks tied to Taiwan’s dominance in semiconductor production. “This situation could also delay the rollout of next-generation products in the US market, affecting timelines for AI, gaming, and high-performance computing innovations,” Rawat said. “Moreover, without access to local, advanced chips, US tech companies will incur higher transportation and import costs, diminishing their profit margins. In competitive sectors like AI and autonomous vehicles, slower time-to-market could weaken global competitiveness.” For TSMC, the delays and challenges could have significant implications for fab operations, particularly in maintaining profitability and efficiency.“Cost of maintaining the fab, the fab utilization rate, and the yield rate are key metrics to keep the fab profitable,” said Neil Shah, partner, and co-founder at Counterpoint Research. “So, TSMC would look to move as much business as possible from its customers to the Arizona fab to match current and future capacity, maintain the utilization rate, and then build on the yield rate to maximize efficiency.” Impact on US semiconductor ambitions Apple and Nvidia, among others, have traditionally sourced chipsets from the Asia-Pacific region. The CHIPS and Science Act aims to shift this dependency toward localized production, promising benefits such as shorter lead times, a more resilient supply chain, reduced reliance on Taiwan, and lower logistics costs. “Thanks to various sanctions, policy, government support, academic initiatives, and investments from private entities such as TSMC, the goal looks achievable,” said Shubham Pandey, senior analyst at Everest Group. “However, the desired results look at least five years of aggressive efforts away.” The biggest missing pieces of this puzzle remain in skilled and semi-skilled talent availability for silicon manufacturing. “While there is a significant cultural and operational gap between the two countries, the level of resources, both human and ecosystem, still needs to mature,” Shah said. “This is where the biggest adjustments will be required. Money or any number of subsidies can’t bridge this gap quickly.” SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

MooMoo,From retail trading to private wealth: Inside Moomoo’s plans to reshape Singapore’s investment landscape - The Business Times,2025-01-21 08:00:00,"From retail trading to private wealth: Inside Moomoo’s plans to reshape Singapore’s investment landscape
After simplifying investing for retail traders, the global platform is now attracting high-net-worth investors with digital solutions for wealth management, says its CEO Gavin Chia
At first glance, a modest office space in SBF Center seems like an unlikely birthplace for a company looking to disrupt Singapore’s finance industry. But that is exactly where Moomoo Singapore’s story began, with chief executive officer Gavin Chia fielding customer service calls on his personal mobile phone during the height of the pandemic in 2020.
“I remember taking calls at midnight from traders watching the US market,” Chia says. “Sometimes they would ask about their accounts, other times they just wanted to discuss investment strategies over coffee. Every call was an opportunity to understand what investors really needed.”
This hands-on approach helped Moomoo transform Singapore’s retail trading landscape. Now, with over a million users on its platform, the company is setting its sights on a bigger prize: the highly competitive private wealth management market dominated by private banks.
“The wealthy investors of today are different. They’re tech-savvy, they want transparency, and they’re questioning the traditional private banking model. We’re building something that combines the best of both worlds: cutting-edge technology with personalised service, but without the traditional constraints and costs,” says Chia.
Targeting the high-net-worth space
Moomoo formally launched its platform in Singapore in March 2021, targeting retail investors by letting them trade Singapore, Hong Kong and US-listed stocks by paying just a fraction of the fees charged by traditional brokers.
Since its launch in March 2021, Chia says Moomoo has experienced impressive growth in Singapore which includes its one million users. “Achieving this within just three years highlights the platform’s strong appeal to the country’s digitally savvy investors,” he adds.

“Everything we’ve achieved came from listening to our users,” Chia reflects. “After reaching our milestone of one million users, we asked ourselves, ‘what’s next?’. Our clients’ wealth has grown alongside us and they’re seeking more sophisticated investment solutions.
“That’s why we launched Moomoo Private Wealth, to provide comprehensive wealth management services without the traditional banking overhead. It’s the natural evolution of our platform, built on the same principle of responding to what our community needs,” he adds.
Bridging high-tech and high-touch
Moomoo Private Wealth caters to clients with more than US$1 million in investments by providing them with access to a wider range of investment products that combine technology with the human touch to help investors grow and protect their wealth. These investors also enjoy bespoke services such as the help of a relationship manager and professional trading team.
“We wanted to apply the same principle of making investing more accessible, utilising our tech-enabled platform to complement the personalised service that high-net-worth individuals have come to expect,” Chia says.
High-net-worth individuals are not just ready for digital solutions – they are actively seeking them out, according to a study commissioned by Moomoo earlier this year. The study so noted that contrary to conventional wisdom, wealthier clients are more receptive to automated solutions compared to investors with fewer assets.
Other key trends the study revealed include high-net-worth individuals’ interest in advanced portfolio tracking and performance analysis tools – emphasising the need for comprehensive solutions that offer a complete financial overview – and a preference for seamless integration with existing financial accounts and platforms.
This created opportunities for digital platforms like Moomoo in the private banking space as a new generation of investment and tech savvy clients seek hybrid solutions that combine technology with personal advice.
The report by Ben Charoenwong, an Insead academic who was then an associate professor with the National University of Singapore, and Alan Kwan, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, notes that while traditional financial institutions have made significant strides in digital transformation, “their efforts often fall short of revolutionising wealth management”.
“A fundamental challenge lies in the inherent conflict of interest in many incumbent banks’ business models. These institutions may prioritise channeling clients towards their own proprietary products, which may not always align with the client’s best interests or offer the most appropriate solutions for their unique financial situations,” the two finance professors wrote in the report.
Explaining how Moomoo intends to target the high-net-worth space, Chia says many family offices are sophisticated investors with their own research staff. “So how Moomoo comes in is as a neutral party. They will use our platform because of the convenience in terms of research and the fundamental and technical analysis.”
Despite this push into the high-net-worth space, Chia says that Moomoo has not forgotten its roots. While clients can no longer reach him on his personal phone, he remains accessible through events like the annual MooFest, where investors of all levels can interact with Moomoo executives and fund managers.
“We’ve come a long way, but our mission hasn’t changed,” he says. “Whether you’re making your first trade or managing generational wealth, we’re here to make investing more accessible, more transparent, and more efficient. The future of wealth management isn’t about choosing between human touch and technology – it’s about combining both in ways that truly serve investors’ needs.
“It’s been an incredible privilege to witness our growth in Singapore — from starting in a small office to now leading a team of nearly 100 in the heart of the central business district… but our mission is far from over. There’s so much more to do as we continue to elevate the investing experience, and I’m excited to write the next chapter of our story together.”

Market Definition
A retimer is a specialized electronic device that regenerates digital signals by extracting the embedded clock, recovering the data, and retransmitting a fresh copy with a clean clock. It amplifies the signal, reshapes it, and ensures data integrity over long distances or through channels with high attenuation.
A retimer extracts the embedded clock from the incoming data stream, which allows it to synchronize the timing of the data signals accurately. They enhance the quality of the signal by compensating for losses and distortions that occur during transmission. This includes equalization functions that help restore the amplitude and clarity of the signal, making it suitable for high-speed applications. They are designed to be aware of the communication protocols they are handling, enabling them to adapt to various standards such as PCIe, USB4, and others. This feature allows for automatic configuration and optimization of the signal transmission without manual tuning, simplifying system integration. Unlike simple redrivers that amplify signals (including noise), they recreate the original signal by generating a clean copy, which helps maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. This process is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially at higher data rates where noise can significantly impact performance.

Pop Mart,Luxury or toy? POP MART launches jewellery brand POPOP - Dao Insights,2025-01-20 08:00:00,"On 17 January, it was reported that Chinese toymaker POP MART had launched its jewellery line under the POPOP moniker. Pop-up shops were opened on the previous day in both Shanghai and Shenzhen. With POP MART’s recent results, it was natural that the new category extension from the brand would quickly make headlines across the web.
As a brand, POPOP is mostly a high-street-to-premium fashion jewellery brand with predominantly sterling silver (92.5% silver), cubic zirconia and artificial pearl items. It is positioned akin to Swarovski or Pandora, apart from one key element, which is, of course, the original POP MART IPs. Popular IPs such as MOLLY, LABUBU and HIRONO are all present in the designs of POPOP, which is the main draw and differentiation between the brand and other similarly priced products.
This is not the first time the blind box maker has attempted to expand into the jewellery market. Limited editions and pop-ups were launched last year to test the waters. However, the latest launch of POPOP seems to be met with controversies over its pricing, especially the limited-edition sterling silver SKULLPANDA necklace that will set you back 2,699 RMB (368.25 USD). Netizens jokingly say that POP MART is aiming to become a luxury brand. However, there has been a saying online that the people who buy LABUBU are the same crowd buying Hermès because of the celebrity endorsements and “emotional value” that has lured middle-class consumers away from luxury.
In fact, brands such as Swarovski and Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook often launch collaborations with international IPs such as Pokémon and Sanrio Characters. POP MART also teamed up with Hong Kong-based jeweller Chow Sang Sang for a co-branded jewellery collection.
Gold Prices grew significantly in 2024 and remain high in 2025. This has caused traditional “gold shop” jewellers to see huge decreases in revenue and profit. Take Chow Tai Fook as an example, in H1 FY2025 (6 months ending 30 September), the brand saw a 20.4% year-on-year (YoY) drop in revenue to 39.41 billion HKD (5.06 billion USD), and a whopping 44.4% decrease in profit. With high gold prices, aspiring customers will likely move away from gold and luxury jewellery for the time being. Whether POPOP can plug the vacuum with the “emotional value” it provides with original IPs is worth monitoring.","[{'head': 'POP MART', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'brand', 'tail': 'POPOP'}, {'head': 'POP MART', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'executive', 'tail': 'Chow Sang Sang'}, {'head': 'Chow Tai Fook', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'jewellery_brand', 'tail': 'Chow Tai Fook'}]","['labubu', 'hirono', 'gold prices', 'pop mart', 'pokémon', 'sanrio characters', 'jewellery', 'popop - dao insights', 'pop mart’s', 'popop', 'yoy', 'chow sang sang', 'netizens', 'chow tai fook', 'ips', 'swarovski']","- POP MART launched its new jewellery line, POPOP, on January 17, with pop-up shops in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Montage Technology,European Union orders X to hand over algorithm documents - Ars Technica,2025-01-17 08:00:00,"Brussels has ordered Elon Musk to fully disclose recent changes made to recommendations on X, stepping up an investigation into the role of the social media platform in European politics.

In addition, the EU regulator requested access to information on how the social media network moderates and amplifies content.
The move follows complaints from politicians in Germany that X’s algorithm is promoting content by the far right ahead of the country’s February 23 elections.

Head of dealing, Ken Low, noted that startups focused on artificial intelligence and fintech innovations, along with renewable energy firms specialising in solar power and electric vehicle infrastructure, are gaining traction amid global sustainability goals.
“These dynamics present diverse opportunities for retail investors, and staying informed about upcoming IPOs and aligning investments with long-term growth sectors can help investors capitalise on these trends,” Low stated.
Low emphasised Malaysia’s remarkable IPO performance in 2024, with 55 IPOs recorded—the highest in ASEAN—raising the most substantial value of funds in the region. This stellar performance not only bolstered investor confidence but also contributed significantly to the nation’s economy.
Looking ahead, 2025 is poised for another strong year for IPOs, with experts forecasting approximately 50 new listings on Bursa Malaysia. Low attributed this optimism to Malaysia’s robust economic fundamentals and the increasing diversity of sectors entering the market, spanning technology, renewable energy, consumer goods, and logistics.
Among the anticipated IPOs, Oriental Kopi Holdings Bhd (Oriental Kopi) has generated excitement as the third listing of the year on the ACE Market on Jan 23, 2025. Priced at 44 sen per share, the IPO aims to raise RM183.96 million, with proceeds earmarked for working capital, a new head office, central kitchen, warehouse, domestic expansion, and marketing efforts, including its packaged food segment.
This comes as Malaysia’s food and beverage industry continues to grow, with the domestic sector recording RM228.66 billion in revenue in 2023 and a compound annual growth rate forecast of 7.95% from 2023 to 2027.
“Key indicators signal the potential for Oriental Kopi to further establish themselves as a major player in the local café and packaged foods sector,” Low added.

Chinasoft International,China’s Soft Power Play: How Video Games Are Boosting Beijing’s Global Influence - The Diplomat – Asia-Pacific Current Affairs Magazine,2025-01-16 08:00:00,"China’s global ambitions are no longer confined to infrastructure megaprojects or its booming trade networks. The country has found an unlikely but effective tool for soft power: video games. At the heart of this strategy lies Chinese tech giant Tencent, whose dominance in the gaming world has turned digital entertainment into a powerful vehicle for projecting China’s culture and influence globally.
For decades, soft power – a country’s ability to attract and persuade others through cultural appeal rather than coercion – has been shaped by Western forces. Hollywood movies, American music, and Japanese anime have long been the main cultural exports dominating global pop culture. But China, too, is now stepping into this space with a surprising contender: its rapidly growing gaming industry.
Tencent’s Global Gaming Empire
Tencent, China’s largest tech conglomerate, has quietly established itself as a global leader in the gaming industry over the past decade. Through acquisitions and investments, the company has built a gaming empire that spans the globe. Tencent owns Riot Games, the developer behind “League of Legends,” one of the most popular e-sports titles in the world. It holds a 40 percent stake in Epic Games, creators of “Fortnite,” a cultural juggernaut with a player base exceeding 400 million worldwide.
Tencent’s strategy is simple yet powerful: invest in games that captivate international audiences while integrating elements of Chinese culture into the gaming experience. This approach does not rely on overt messaging or propaganda. Instead, it weaves subtle threads of Chinese history, mythology, and aesthetics into engaging, interactive platforms that appeal to millions worldwide.
Take “Honor of Kings,” Tencent’s flagship mobile game and one of the world’s most played titles. Originally designed with heavy Chinese cultural themes, the game has expanded globally under the name “Arena of Valor.” However, in recent years, Tencent has brought “Honor of Kings” – complete with its rich Chinese mythology – directly to Western markets, signaling confidence that global audiences are now ready to embrace culturally specific content.
The Cultural Footprint in Gaming
What sets China’s gaming soft power apart is its subtlety. Games are not didactic tools but immersive experiences that allow players to engage with Chinese culture on their own terms. Characters inspired by ancient Chinese figures, such as the legendary craftsman Lu Ban or the Monkey King from the classic novel “Journey to the West,” are seamlessly integrated into games like “Honor of Kings” and “Fortnite.” These inclusions don’t just add novelty; they introduce global audiences to Chinese folklore and history in a way that feels natural and entertaining.
Another game, “Black Myth: Wukong,” developed by Chinese studio Game Science, has generated significant buzz for its breathtaking visuals and compelling adaptation of “Journey to the West.” While Western games have long borrowed Chinese themes in superficial ways, “Black Myth” offers a more authentic experience rooted in Chinese mythology. Its international popularity highlights a growing appetite for culturally rich content beyond the Western-centric narratives that have historically dominated the gaming industry.
Tencent’s influence extends beyond individual titles. The company plays a central role in the booming global e-sports industry, which has become a cultural phenomenon in its own right. Games like “League of Legends,” under Tencent’s stewardship, have created international tournaments watched by millions. These events often feature Chinese branding, sponsors, and even nods to Chinese cultural elements, further embedding China’s influence into global gaming culture.
A Digital Silk Road of Influence
China’s embrace of gaming as a soft power tool fits within its broader strategy under the Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative – the digital arm of the Belt and Road Initiative. While the DSR is often associated with infrastructure like fiber-optic cables and 5G networks, it also promotes the global reach of Chinese digital services, including e-commerce, payment systems, and entertainment platforms like Tencent’s games.
This strategic push ensures that Chinese-developed games are accessible worldwide, particularly in developing markets where China is actively expanding its digital footprint. By establishing itself as a technological leader and cultural exporter, China is positioning its digital platforms – and the narratives they carry – at the center of global digital culture.
A Mixed Reception
While Tencent’s gaming portfolio has achieved immense commercial success and cultural impact, it has not been without controversy. Some critics point to concerns about the export of China’s digital governance model, which emphasizes state control over internet content. Tencent, like other Chinese tech giants, maintains close ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), raising questions about the intersection of state interests and corporate strategy.
Tencent’s success in global gaming also highlights a broader tension between cultural exchange and influence. On one hand, games like “Honor of Kings” and “Black Myth: Wukong” showcase Chinese culture, fostering greater appreciation among international audiences. On the other, the integration of Chinese narratives into widely consumed entertainment raises concerns about the subtle influence of state-backed initiatives in shaping global perceptions.
A New Era of Cultural Diplomacy
Despite these challenges, China’s use of gaming as a soft power tool represents an innovative shift in cultural diplomacy. Video games are uniquely positioned to engage global audiences in ways that traditional media cannot. They are interactive, immersive, and deeply social, offering opportunities for cultural exchange that feel organic and engaging rather than top-down.
For China, this strategy well facilitates with a departure from its previously assertive diplomatic posture, often referred to as “wolf warrior diplomacy.” Instead of confrontation, China’s gaming industry offers collaboration, cultural storytelling, and shared entertainment experiences. This softer approach has the potential to reshape how global audiences perceive China, presenting it not just as a rising power but also as a vibrant cultural force.
As video games continue to grow as a dominant form of global entertainment, China’s strategic investments in this sector are likely to yield long-term cultural dividends. Tencent’s success highlights how digital entertainment can serve as a bridge for cultural exchange, positioning China as a key player in shaping the future of global digital culture.
Whether through mythological heroes in “Honor of Kings” or e-sports spectacles watched by millions, China’s gaming industry is redefining the role of digital platforms in soft power. For Beijing, the next frontier of global influence is not just on land or sea – it’s in the immersive worlds where millions of players log in, explore, and connect every day.

Montage Technology,Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise - Financial Times,2025-01-14 08:00:00,"Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise
Simply sign up to the US equities myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.
Investors have poured record amounts of money into a fund that spreads its assets equally across the S&P 500, as concerns mount that Wall Street’s returns have become overly reliant on a handful of technology titans.
The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight exchange traded fund took in about $14.4bn in the second half of 2024, according to data from Morningstar, as investors hedged themselves against the dominance of big technology stocks.
The surge took total inflows for the fund to $17bn for the year and comes after consecutive years of the fund underperforming the S&P. Analysts said it underscored how investors were becoming concerned by the shadow cast by Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
Last year the S&P rose 24 per cent, with the seven responsible for about half of the index’s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The equal weight index rose just 11 per cent as its quarterly rebalance favoured lower growth stocks.
“Investors’ biggest focus recently has been concentration risk, worries that the market is too top-heavy,” said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at Société Générale. He expects to see double-digit earnings growth beyond the biggest tech companies this year.
“If that happens, you don’t need to be so defensively positioned,” he said, adding that “so many people I meet point to the equal-weighted index gaining 11 per cent last year and say it makes more sense to invest there than to expect 20-plus returns [from the market-cap weighted S&P 500] every year.”
The Invesco fund sells the S&P’s leaders and buys its laggards every quarter when it rebalances, to give each of its holdings an equal share of fund assets. That approach was beneficial in 2022, as the index’s largest stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off that year.
In spite of its underperformance, the fund has amassed more than $72bn and made it one of the 25 largest US ETFs by total assets, according to Morningstar. That showing topped the ETF’s previous best for flows of about $12.8bn in 2023, according to Morningstar.
Investors are also turning to derivatives, such as CME Group’s S&P 500-equal weight futures, to bet on the S&P while hedging against a sharp drop in tech stocks. The contract, which launched in February, has averaged open interest of 16,500 contracts this month, worth about $2.4bn.
A sharp drop in the shares of the Magnificent Seven in July and August led to a jump in interest in the contract, said CME global head of equity products Paul Woolman. “I think that woke some more clients up in terms of how to manage that risk and what kind of strategies they should put in place.”
“It is a reflection of market participants wanting to diversify into cheaper assets and not just chasing performance,” said Alessio de Longis, head of investments with Invesco Solutions, a multi-asset arm of the $1.8tn fund manager, of the overall trend towards interest in equal-weighting.
However, Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, said using a fund that adjusted to give each company an equal weighting was unlikely to be the best way to sidestep fears of market concentration.
“Incorporating fundamentals in the assessment of each company would better serve investors than arbitrarily making them all equal weights,” Armour said. “At least, that would better reflect the market’s identity.”
T Rowe Price portfolio manager Rick de los Reyes said the shift in sentiment could help sectors such as energy, metals, mining and other industrial stocks. “There’s some excitement around the parts of the market that have been left behind, and the view that you could finally start to see some strength,” he said.","[{'head': 'Invesco', 'relation': 'owns', 'subtype': 'asset_management', 'tail': 'Invesco Solutions'}, {'head': 'CME Group', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'global_head_of_equity_products', 'tail': 'Paul Woolman'}, {'head': 'Invesco', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'head_of_investments', 'tail': 'Alessio de Longis'}, {'head': 'T Rowe Price', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'portfolio_manager', 'tail': 'Rick de los Reyes'}, {'head': 'Société Générale', 'relation': 'has_executive', 'subtype': 'head_of_us_equity_strategy', 'tail': 'Manish Kabra'}]","['paul woolman', 'cme group’s', 's&p', 'invesco solutions', 'armour', 'rick de los', 'invesco', 'alessio de longis', 'etf', 'microsoft', 'cme', 'apple', 'magnificent seven', 'société générale', 'morningstar', 'financial times investors', 'meta', 'manish kabra', 'digest', 'bryan armour', 'amazon', 'alphabet', 'reyes']","- Investors invested $14.4 billion in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF in the second half of 2024, totaling $17 billion for the year.

- The equal-weight strategy underperformed the S&P 500 last year, gaining only 11% compared to the index's 24% increase.
- In addition to the ETF, interest in derivatives like CME Group’s S&P 500-equal weight futures has grown, averaging open interest worth $2.4 billion.

The partnership between BlackRock Foundation, Commonwealth, Betterment and moomoo creates a unique research ecosystem combining both guided and self-directed investment platforms.

The
The ""Investor Diaries"" project represents a significant development in democratizing financial markets. Traditional market research has historically overlooked LMI investors, creating a blind spot in understanding how financial products and services can better serve this demographic. This research could reshape how investment platforms design their user interfaces and educational tools.
The involvement of both Betterment (automated investing) and moomoo (self-directed trading) provides a comprehensive view of different investment approaches. This dual perspective is important as it will reveal whether LMI investors fare better with automated solutions or self-directed trading, potentially influencing future product development and regulatory frameworks.
The focus on first-generation investors is particularly noteworthy, as it could help break intergenerational barriers to wealth creation and provide insights into developing more inclusive financial products. This research could lead to better-tailored investment solutions and more effective financial education programs for underserved communities.

Commonwealth has partnered with investment platforms Betterment and moomoo to capture participants' experiences with both robo-advised and self-directed platforms:
- Betterment – For investors who don't want to pick their own stocks, Betterment's easy-to-use, automated investment technology offers diversified, expert-built portfolios and continually monitors the investments, rebalances the portfolios, and reinvests the dividends.
- moomoo – Moomoo offers an accessible platform for self-directed investors of all levels to confidently make their own investment decisions with advanced tools and features to help guide their trades.
The Investor Diaries will also include a large National Perceptions and Habits Survey and a parallel study of macro-level investor transaction data to better understand the broad investing behaviors of this population.
""The Investor Diaries will provide a groundbreaking holistic view of those living on modest incomes who are new to investing in the past five years,"" says Timothy Flacke, CEO, Commonwealth. ""Understanding the choices and actions of these new market participants, and where existing platforms and tools are serving these new investors well—and falling short—will inform the next wave of investing innovations and help ensure broader capital market participation is a sustainable, productive source of wealth creation.""
Commonwealth's past research has demonstrated an unmet appetite for investing among LMI households and the early positive impact of this type of market participation on financial stability and mobility.
""Measuring household investing behavior will help determine how supported these new market participants feel in their investing experience,"" says Claire Chamberlain, President, The BlackRock Foundation. ""The insights derived from The Investor Diaries can help inform product solutions, investor education, and outreach strategies to optimally support LMI households in building and sustaining wealth via the capital markets.""

Since its inception in February, Moomoo Securities Malaysia Sdn Bhd has garnered over 500,000 users on its stock trading app. This is partly due to its rapid launch of new products and solutions to level the playing field in the world of investing. It aims to enable the man in the street to participate directly in the stock market by solving their pain points.
For instance, Moomoo launched fractional shares that allow users to invest in companies at just a fraction of their price per share, making it easier for investors to put money in companies like Apple Inc, which was traded at about US$248 per share on Nov 12.
The firm also launched its eIPO solution that lets investors subscribe for initial public offering (IPO) shares with just a few clicks on a screen, and expanded its market access to the US and China. On the latter, investors can invest in China H-shares listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX) and A-shares listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges.
Recently, the firm expanded its Cash Plus offering to distribute not just conventional money market funds, but also shariah-compliant ones. It then launched the SmartSave feature, where investors can park their money in money market funds for returns while using those funds to trade shares instantly when market opportunities arise.
Real-time financial data and analysis tools are also easily accessible through the Moomoo app.
Ivan Mok, CEO of Moomoo Malaysia, says investing directly in the stock market has often been seen as possible for only a select group of wealthier and knowledgeable people. It requires capital, specialised knowledge or access to resources that weren’t readily available to most people.
“Our aim has been to challenge that status quo by making investing simpler and more accessible [to the general public],” he says.
Technology plays a key role in Moomoo’s quest of achieving such a goal, he adds. “By leveraging scalable technology, we can roll out features, including fractional shares, options trading, eIPO and expanded market access in months without compromising security or performance.”
Equally important is its user-first approach, adds Mok. “We don’t launch features in isolation. We launch solutions that align with what investors tell us they need.”
Mok says Malaysia stood out globally among the markets its parent company, Hong Kong-based Futu Holdings Ltd, operates in. They include Singapore, Australia, Japan and Canada.
In the second quarter of 2024 (2Q2024), the number of new paying clients here grew 168%, says Mok. Clients’ assets also surged, where the average client’s assets rose 45% and total clients’ assets more than doubled.
“By 3Q2024, we saw strong double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth in US equity investment and increasing engagement with the Chinese market [by our clients],” he says.
There is no doubt that Moomoo’s aggressive promotional campaign, such as dishing out Apple and Nvidia shares to its clients once they satisfy specific conditions, has contributed to its success. Asked how much was spent on marketing and promotions, Mok says the firm doesn’t disclose the figure.
“Our approach has been about much more than just marketing. It is about building trust, creating awareness and empowering Malaysians to take control of their financial futures,” he says.
Would Moomoo pursue an even more aggressive approach moving forward, such as lowering its fee to zero? Mok says the firm’s priority is to deliver value, as in the overall investing experience it provides, not just pricing.
“Competitive fees are part of that equation, but they’re just one piece of the puzzle. What we focus on is ensuring that every user gets more than just a trading platform. They get a comprehensive ecosystem that helps them make smarter, more confident decisions,” he explains.
Currently, Moomoo is exploring deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics to provide users with personalised insights and smarter tools for portfolio management. This will make it easier for investors to identify opportunities, manage risks and feel confident in their investment decisions, says Mok.
Its broader vision is to create an investment super app, defined as a platform where users can learn more about investing, manage their portfolios and access global markets seamlessly.
Mok adds that Moomoo is not here to challenge existing players, but to grow the market. “We are here to build a more inclusive and dynamic investing ecosystem that encourages participants from all demographics.
“For us, success isn’t measured by the number of users. It is about fostering greater confidence, participation and a deeper understanding of financial markets in Malaysia.”

Depending on what you value in an online brokerage, and the types of accounts you want to open, moomoo may or may not be the best choice. Read on to learn more in our Moomoo Canada Review.

What is moomoo Canada?
Moomoo is an online brokerage created with the goal of providing a platform for investors of all experience levels to engage with the market. Moomoo is an independent brand of Hong Kong-based FUTU Holdings, which is a NASDAQ Listed global financial institution.
While moomoo was founded in Silicon Valley in 2018 it quickly expanded across the globe. In 2021 they earned the top spot for online brokerage apps in Singapore, and it is utilized for international trading in Australia. In Japan, moomoo has become the top choice for US stocks trading.
Moomoo officially launched in Canada in September 2023. Then on March 26, 2024, they rang the opening bell at the Toronto Stock Exchange to celebrate their approval as a TSX and TSXV non-trading member.
The following infographic taken from their website gives you an idea of their global presence.
Is it Safe and Trusted?
While moomoo is a newer brokerage available to Canadians, and has a name that some find silly despite the intended connection to a bull market, it is indeed a legitimate brokerage.
Moomoo Financial Canada Inc., a brand of FUTU Holdings listed on the NASDAQ, is also a member of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF) and is regulated by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organisation (CIRO).
This protects the securities of clients up to $1 million for each general account. It’s important to note, however, that while the CIPF protects eligible customers in the event of a CIRO dealer member’s insolvency, it does not cover losses incurred due to fluctuations in market values.
Moomoo Canada Fees
With online brokerages, fees need to be low in order to be a top contender in the Canada discount brokerage scene. When it comes to fees with moomoo you won’t be paying much! This is one of the stand-out features of this new-to-Canada online brokerage.
| Canadian Stocks and ETFs | CAD $0.0149/share, Minimum CAD $1.49 per trade |
| US Stocks and ETFs | US $0.0099/share, Minimum US $1.99 per trade |
| US Options (stock options and index options) | $0.90/contract, Minimum $1.50 per orderExercise/assignments fee: $0 |
| Margin Rate (in USD) | Under $100,000: 8.83%$100,000 – $1 million: 8.33%$1 million – $50 million: 8.08%$50 million – $200 million: 7.83%Over $200 million: 7.83% |
| FX Fees | 0.09% plus USD $2 per transaction |
| Account Fees (Opening and Closing) | $0 |
| Account Minimum | $0 |
| Deposits via Bank Transfer (EFT) | $0 |
| Electronic Statements and Trade Confirmations | $0 |
| Withdrawal Fees | From cash, margin, and TFSA accounts the first withdrawal per month is free, then cost $2-$12 each. The first withdrawal per month from RRSP accounts cost $50; subsequent withdrawals are $52-$62 each. |
| Inactive Account | $0 |
As you can see in the table above, moomoo offers stocks, ETFs, and options at a very affordable cost. We also love to see that there are no account fees and no withdrawal fees. All this on top of a $0 account minimum so you can get started investing at any point!
However, there are no caps on trading fees, so for investors trading large blocks of shares, they will pay a high cost. In contrast, many other brokers have a maximum trading fee.
Account Options
Moomoo Canada offers a limited selection of accounts, offering just 4 different account types. This is a downfall as other top Canadian online brokers offer a much more diverse variety of account options and holdings. Moomoo Canada’s current account offerings are:
Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP): Within a moomoo RRSP account, you can invest in stocks, ETFs, and options, with taxes deferred until you make a withdrawal, typically during retirement. RRSP accounts are available for individuals, as well as for spouses.
Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSA): TFSAs are a highly beneficial account option for Canadian investors. They allow you to invest in stocks, ETFs, and options, with the added advantage of tax-free earnings and withdrawals.
Cash accounts: Cash accounts are simple and versatile, allowing you to buy and sell stocks, ETFs, and options. They typically come in various forms, including individual, joint, corporate, and group accounts, but moomoo only offers individual accounts at this point in time.
Margin accounts: Margin accounts enable you to borrow money against your securities to trade at competitive rates. However, it’s important to note that this is the only account type where you’ll be required to pay interest.
Unfortunately, they do not offer First Home Savings Accounts (FHSA), Registered Education Savings Plans (RESP), RIFs, LIRAs, corporate and joint accounts – all of which are very popular accounts with Canadians, for good reason. They also don’t have certain popular asset classes such as bonds or mutual funds. So, for clients who like to open many account types and asset classes, and then keep all of their investments with one brokerage, moomoo will not be a good fit.
Furthermore, for some reason, if you wish to open a TFSA account with moomoo, you must open it as your first account with them. This is likely important to note because it means you have to plan the order in which you open accounts.
Additionally, when it comes to setting up your account, transfers in kind (of cash or securities) from a cash or margin account to an RRSP or TFSA are not supported.
As you have probably gathered, the account options and ease of opening them have not been an impressive feature of moomoo!
Investment Options
Moomoo Canada has fairly limited asset classes. Unfortunately, they are only open to US and Canadian markets. Here are the investment choices that moomoo Canada does offer:
Stocks: Stocks, or shares/equities, represent ownership in a company. Investing in stocks offers the potential for higher returns over time, as they have historically outperformed other investment options such as cash equivalents, GICs, or bonds. However, this comes with a higher level of risk. Moomoo has over 7000 US stocks, and all the stocks listed on the major Canadian trading platforms.
ETFs: ETFs contain a diversified mix of assets, including stocks, bonds, or commodities, helping to spread risk across various asset classes. With moomoo, you can choose from over 5000 US-listed and Canadian-listed ETFs. These include Index ETFs, Bond ETFs, All-In-One ETFs, Sector-Specific ETFs, Commodity ETFs, Dividend ETFs, Factor-Based ETFs, Inverse ETFs, and Leveraged ETFs.
Options: An option grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or security at a predetermined price, on or before a specified date. Options trading can be complex and involves inherent risks, so it may not be suitable for novice investors. To learn more about Options trading and our top picks for options brokers, check out our Options Trading Guide in Canada article. Moomoo offers options that can be held in your cash, margin, TFSA, and RRSP accounts. They currently only offer US stock options.
Cash Plus: This earns you 2% p.a. cash rebates that are automatically redistributed each week. It can only be held in your margin and cash accounts.
Extra Features
Moomoo’s online trading platform is widely recognized for its advanced trading tools and global market access. They offer real-time alerts with free access to updated market data every 0.03 seconds.
Moomoo also offers the option to customize your trading charts with many different features:
- Multi-Monitor Setups
- Technical Indicators
- Drawing Tools
- Custom Indicators
There are also many features for stock analysis when trading stocks. These include information on:
- Short Sale Volume
- Institutional Holdings
- Company Valuation
- Financial Reports.
Moomoo also offers a demo paper trading account. This gives you a chance to see how moomoo’s trading platform works, without investing your own money. The paper trading demo gives you $1 million in virtual money and access to more than 10,000 stocks and options. This demo also includes educational resources and the opportunity to take part in paper trade competitions.
Moomoo Mobile App Review
At this point, we expect all online brokers, banks, etc. to offer clients functional, easy-to-navigate stock trading apps so that they can perform actions anytime, anywhere, with their mobile device or tablet.
The moomoo Trading & Investing mobile app is an easy-to-use app with many functions. The app can be used to trade US stocks from 4am to 8pm ET, and Canadian stocks from 8am to 5pm ET. It can be used to analyze stocks, and you can engage with experts and other users to view live streaming and trending discussions. Furthermore, the app can also be used to access financial news from credible sources such as Bloomberg, Dow Jones, Benzinga, and Investorplace, all for free!
Here is a screenshot from their website showing some of their app features:
Android users and Apple users alike rate it highly: 4.5 stars from over 31,000 reviews on the Google Play Store, and 4.6 stars from 1000 reviews on the Apple App Store. Users commonly comment on the ease of use and the straightforward layout and organization of the app.
The app is also linked to 24/7 customer care: professional support from licensed professionals by live chat, phone, or email.
For a more in-depth look at their mobile app, check out their App Features page in their online Help Center.
Moomoo can also be downloaded for desktop trading for those who prefer to use their computer when making trades but they do not offer web-based trading.
How to Open an Account
The process of opening an account with moomoo Canada is pretty simple. According to their website’s Help Center, it is a simple 5 step process:
- Submit an application via either the app or on the website
- Your account will be approved within 2 business days if all the provided information is verified
- If additional documents are required, the instructions will be sent via email
- An email will be sent containing your account details once approved
- Lastly, access the Client Portal to update your temporary password
For all accounts, you need to have Canadian citizenship or tax residency. The following table outlines what you need specifically for each account type:

From our experience, account opening takes 1-3 days.
Once you have opened an account you can use the moomoo app to add another account type. But please note, that if you wish to open a TFSA with moomoo, it must be opened as your first account.

Moomoo Canada Review FAQ
Is moomoo right for you?
As an online Canadian brokerage, moomoo is good, but not the best. It has some stand-out features, but falls short in many areas when compared to other options such as Qtrade and Questrade. However, despite the downfalls, they still come out above the big bank brokers.
While we love the low fees and in-depth online trading interface, it is lacking in account options and asset classes, and has an absence of global market options. This causes it to drop down in our rankings. If you are most focused on US and Canadian stocks and ETFs and are happy with the limited account offerings, then moomoo may be a good choice for you.
Otherwise, we recommend you check out our list of the Top Online Brokers in Canada, where you’ll see that Qtrade is ranked at the top. To learn why, visit our complete Qtrade review.

Zhenyu Technology,Interpreting price momentums in Chinese stock markets - South China Morning Post,2025-01-10 08:00:00,"Interpreting price momentums in Chinese stock markets
Certain retail investors fuel daily price changes in emerging stock markets, but these fluctuations may be prone to loss
[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]
There is a tendency for stocks that have performed well in the past to continue performing well in the short term and vice versa. This pattern is called price momentum, which reflects the idea that past performance can influence future stock movements. In the US stock markets, this price momentum presents in the medium-term range of one to 12 months before it reverses in the long-term range of two to five years.
However, such medium momentum and long-term price reversal are absent in Chinese bourses, despite being the world’s second-largest with more than 4,700 listed stocks. Instead, their stock prices exhibit strong momentum at the daily level, indicating daily price momentum.
“In daily price momentum, stocks in Chinese markets exhibiting strong performance today are likely to maintain this outperformance tomorrow,” says Jiang Wenxi, Associate Professor in the Department of Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School. “This momentum persists for one to two days before exhibiting a reversal within a week.”
In a research paper titled Daily momentum and new investors in an emerging stock market, Professor Jiang and an Associate Professor in the same department, Gao Zhenyu, along with Xiong Wei A of Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Xiong Wei of Princeton University, tried to cast light on this phenomenon.
“The Chinese stock market is predominantly occupied by retail investors and is characterised by frequent influxes of new investors, a common trait among emerging markets,” says Professor Jiang. “These new investors, possessing limited investment experience, are prone to cognitive biases and susceptible to the emotional impacts of market fluctuations.”",[],"['shenzhen stock exchange', 'the chinese university of hong kong (', 'the department of finance', 'jiang', 'gao zhenyu', 'jiang wenxi', 'princeton university', 'xiong wei']","- Chinese stock markets exhibit daily price momentum, where strong performance tends to continue for one to two days before reversing within a week.

Zhenyu Technology,Vimian Group Among 3 Stocks Estimated To Be Trading Below Their Intrinsic Value - Yahoo Finance,2025-01-08 08:00:00,"In This Article:
As global markets navigate mixed signals with U.S. stocks closing out a strong year despite recent slumps, and economic indicators like the Chicago PMI pointing to potential challenges ahead, investors are increasingly on the lookout for opportunities that may be trading below their intrinsic value. In this context, identifying undervalued stocks becomes crucial as they can offer potential growth even amid fluctuating market conditions.

MooMoo,Moomoo Review | Australia's Value-first broker - thebull.com.au,2025-01-05 10:20:38,"Moomoo
Moomoo is next-generation investment platform looking to use the latest FinTech functionality to revolutionise the ways Australian investors can build their wealth. Founded in Silicon Valley in 2018 the firm’s innovative approach was first introduced to Australian clients in 2022, but despite being a relatively new entrant into the broker sector moomoo already has a global user base of 24m+ . Annual trading volumes have exceeded A$768bn and client assets have grown to A$137bn.
There are plenty of good reasons for moomoo experiencing such rapid growth. The regulatory infrastructure is sound, trading costs are low, and being able to apply the latest technology to the platform’s trading platform has resulted in moomoo clients benefiting from a range of nice-to-have features which make investing more user-friendly.
Commitment to the Australia market extends beyond Moomoo Securities Australia Ltd providing a high-quality service and having an office in downtown Sydney, at Level 17, 570 George Street Sydney NSW 2000. The investment in ‘outreach’ and ‘engagement’ includes invitations to face to face meetings and events such as the moomoo’s Australia analyst Jessica Amir visiting the University of New South Wales to engage with university’s FinTech Society and discuss investing techniques with students.
Whilst moomoo undoubtedly has a ‘new kid on the block’ feel, that doesn’t mean that operational risks are greater than they are with any other broker. Moomoo’s Australian operations are provided by Moomoo Securities Australia Ltd, ABN 51 095 920 648, an Australian Financial Services Licensee (AFSL No. 224663).
Additional security features include the fact that the parent company of moomoo is the Nasdaq-listed FinTech company Futu Holdings Limited. That means the company has to comply with the reporting rules and regulation of the Nasdaq exchange and provide transparency to investors. It’s listing on the Nasdaq being under the ticker FUTU, which at time of writing has a market capitalization of A$ 18.9bn
The move by moomoo into the Australian market has been met with popular and industry recognition. Glowing client testimonials can be found on the moomoo site and there has also been positive feedback from local financial publications and platforms. These include moomoo being awarded “Outstanding Value for Active Investors” and “Outstanding Value for Casual Investors” by Australia’s leading financial comparison site, Canstar, at its 2024 Online Share Trading Platform Awards. In the same year, moomoo was also presented with the title of “Best Stock Trading App” at the FinTech Breakthrough Awards.
Judging by the growth in the client base Moomoo’s distinctive approach is obviously ticking the box for a lot of traders and investors. This review will consider the pros and cons of their approach and outline the reasons why the broker might be the best fit for your style of trading.
Moomoo offers its clients the opportunity to trade in 22,000 markets. It provides access to Australian and international investment opportunities via investments in stocks, ETFs, and options.
The impressive number of markets available to trade illustrates one element of the moomoo approach, taking steps to offer clients something different. The fact that the broker offers clients only one type of account offers a view of the other side of the moomoo way of doing things, keeping things as streamlined as possible.
The moomoo cash account is set up to support individuals. It does not offer leverage, and joint accounts are not yet available; however, corporate and SMSF accounts are supported. The live account is backed up by a free to use Demo / Paper Trading account which allows clients to get a better understanding of how things work and test new strategies in a risk-free environment. That approach might be disadvantageous to some, but the uptake of the cash account is proof enough that the rest of the moomoo service is getting things right.
The CHESS sponsored ASX trading and Cash Plus tools offered by moomoo are neat features which will appeal to many. CHESS, short for Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, is the system used by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) to record shareholdings. Clients of moomoo who trade and hold ‘CHESS Sponsored’ shares can take additional comfort form the ASX having a direct record of ownership. They are held in the client’s name which provides an extra layer of security over assets. The Cash Plus tool allows moomoo clients to sweep uninvested cash into an account which pays interest on the balance, these funds can be diverted to investing in financial instruments or returned to your personal banking account at any time.
Getting set up to take advantage of the moomoo service requires a minimum account opening balance of just $1 and there are no registration or ongoing administration charges. Opening an account is done online, and involves working through a range of industry standard questions which form part of the broker’s KYC (Know Your Client) protocols. Once your account is set up you can fund it using Bank Transfer (BSB+Account) and PayID. The length of time taken for funds to be credited to your account will vary depending on which payment provider you use, and some third parties may apply a charge on cash transfers.
One of Moomoo’s major selling points is the way it aims to provide Australian investors with cost-effective trading. There are no fees associated with opening and holding an account which means that any costs can be easily assessed by calculating the charges associated with each trade.
You can trade US stocks & ETFs from $0.99 per order, though it is important to check if pass-through fees and FX conversion costs apply when trading international markets. Commissions on trades in Australian listed instruments start from as little as $3 per order, or 0.03% of transaction value, whichever is larger, and that very competitive rate includes GST.
Not only are moomoo trading fees and commissions low, but they are laid out in a clear and transparent manner which just makes investing easier. The headline rates on commissions cover most instruments and those who want to take their cost-benefit analysis to a deeper level can make use of the Fee Calculator tool which breaks down total charges to their respective elements.
Online feedback suggest that those looking to ensure they keep frictional costs to a minimum would do well to check the T&Cs regarding cash deposits and withdrawals and selecting the most cost-effective approach. Moomoo does not charge any fees regarding your deposits, but there may be bank charges but your bank or a third-party. When funds are returned to clients banking accounts there any handling fees applied which will be passed on to clients.
The potential advantages of the FinTech aspect of moomoo’s approach has been picked up on by The Australian
“Moomoo leverages artificial intelligence to deliver an intuitive and powerful investing experience for both beginners and seasoned traders. The platform uses state-of-the-art technology to deliver real-time data and features a robust suite of analytic tools, empowering traders to navigate the sharemarket with precision.”
Bankrate.com is a fan of the moomoo trading experience. In their review they stated that.
“Moomoo provides traders quick views of the most active stocks or the biggest movers, and allows you to quickly shift between winners and losers across several markets… If you want to break things down even further, you can quickly search for high-performing stocks by exchange …
You can screen for stocks meeting certain financial or technical criteria, and then store them on a watchlist for later…
When it’s time to trade, moomoo offers free real-time Level II data from Nasdaq, helping traders make smarter decisions about the depth of the markets for individual stocks. It’s a nice add-on feature for clients looking to trade actively.”
One of moomoo’s advantages as a relatively new entrant is that the functionality of its trading dashboards and apps benefits from the latest technology. Investopedia picks out how this converts to a new style of trading experience.
“The trading experience on moomoo’s platforms is smooth. It is easy to choose the type of trade you want to make and to identify the individual security. The interface can be customized and changes made on one platform are visible on the other platform, so you do not have to make the same configuration more than once.“
Analysts at Daytrading.com took time to compliment moomoo on the suite of research and analysis tools on offer.
“Moomoo’s library of stock analysis features is particularly impressive. The platform is packed with analysis tools and financials, including sentiment indicators, institutional data and balance sheets.
I particularly appreciate the customizable stock screener, which allows me to filter through thousands of stocks using 100+ indicators.”
Moomoo customer support can be contacted seven days a week. During trading days, the service runs around the clock which helps the broker score highly in this category and on weekends and holidays support is available between 9.30 am and 9.30 pm, AET.
There is a telephone service hotline, a Live Chat function, and the option to use email when there is a need to provide a more detailed explanation of what support is needed. During our testing we found the moomoo support team to be informed, customer focused, and able to address our issues at the first time of asking.
The FAQs section of the brokers site is very well thought. It covers a range of commonly raised issues and also expands into how to trade, what different instruments are, and how to get the most out of the services moomoo offers. Information is provided in the form of standard FAQs but there are also bite-sized informational videos which do a good job of providing answers to many of the questions which might be raised.
Trading through moomoo is done via in-house developed desktop, web, and mobile app platforms. The desktop dashboard and mobile app are closely aligned in terms of functionality. Whichever dashboard you choose to use they all have the feel of an app rather than a conventional trading platform. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The layout can be set out to suit personal preference and the aesthetics are those of a modern-day software package.
Trading support features are kept to one side to allow the main screens to remain uncluttered, but a range of advanced tools can be seamlessly applied to price charts to help with analysis and spotting the next trading opportunity. These additional monitors include a Market Depth monitor which allows clients to look into price action to a granular level and a Sentiment Indicator which scours market data points to give an easy to use ‘bullish’ or ‘bearish’ reading on a stock, ETF, or option.
Other high-level trading tools which can be used include Pattern Recognition software, automated and manual Risk Management orders, Real Time alerts, Short Sale analysis, and Market Position graphics which highlight technical analysis support and resistance levels.
Those wishing to utilise even more charting and technical analysis tools have the option to link their moomoo account to the well-regarded TradingView platform. That provides traders with access 110+ more trading indicators and market leading news updates.
The moomoo app has been set up with enough functionality and features for clients to be able to use handheld devices as the cornerstone of their investing. It is fully integrated with the desktop platform so clients can seamlessly move from one device to another, but the app is strong enough to be used on its own – as borne out by it winning the “Best Stock Trading App” at the FinTech Breakthrough awards of 2024.
Moomoo clients can use the app to access to advanced charting tools, technical analytics, and in-depth data. It also offers more than just ‘trading on the go’ with users able to join forum discussions, monitor trending topics, and take part in seminars to better their investment knowledge and understanding.
Moomoo’s approach to Robo Trading mirrors the one it takes to the rest of the investment process. It uses innovative features to provide a user-friendly way for clients to trade the markets using automated trading models and pursue a hands-off style of trading.
The Moomoo Algo tool allows clients to develop algo based trading models without having to learn how to code. Instead, a neat interface allows users to drag and drop conditions and metrics they want to apply to their trading. Once your theoretical model has been set up, you can back test it against historical market data to establish how effective it is before deploying it into the market.
One area where moomoo scores highly is on research and learning, and analysis tools. This is partly because the platform uses its FinTech credentials to fully embrace some innovative ways of developing the trading and investing skills of its clients.
With moomoo being a natural starting point for complete beginners there is no surprise that the educational materials start at the base level. Articles on ‘What are stocks’ are ideally pitched to their target audience and the intermediate materials which provide for natural progression are equally informative and engaging.

The research library also covers current topics and trading ideas, such as the relative strengths of EV and AI investing. There is information on housekeeping matters such as account management with the library of resources covering topics ranging from tax filings to effective cash management.
One of the most popular and standout features of the moomoo platform is the Moo Community social trading service. Moo Community provides a forum for the millions of moomoo users to share their own ideas and take on those of others. The Feed is a catch-all forum ideal for those looking for their next investment idea, the Topics section allows users to filter their research to favoured sectors and stocks, and the Featured Content area of the Moo Community captures key market events which could trigger changes to higher level macroeconomic trends.
